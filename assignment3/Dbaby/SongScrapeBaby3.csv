0,Red Light Green Light,"Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie up
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it

Red light, green light
I'm fucking a bitch in my g-nights
I hop out with that stick with that be like
My patner wanna see something killed
That's what he like
Told the first nigga try gon' tell G
How I bent out that motherfucking Saks since a knee high
Since a nappy head black gangsta peon
Have emotion I'm prime time like Deon
How she throw it, I snap from the behind
Hold up, look at the fit on me
Go get the tissue, that shit on me
Lie for me, die for me, kill for me, shit
Thick in the balls when she lick on me
I told her, ""Bae show me you love me"" (Show me)
Let 'em know out in public (Let em' know)
Uh huh, let em know while we fucking
They try me, it go down, you know how I'm coming

Yeah, rich ass stepper
The big white seats
Bitch, that's leather
I wanna fuck her and her friend
And I heard birds of the same feather
They flock together (Let's go)
I'm dangerous, they prolly tell you
What they say?
Don't play with him they 'bout whatever
Ah I get in there, she say I'm pressure
(Get in there) anywhere any time bitch whoever
But hold up

Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie (Park it)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it

Red light, green light (Let's go)
Nigga touch one of yours he gon' see right
I'ma spend every dollar til he die
I make him slide 365, you don't think right
That's 11 months straight nigga sleep tight
I tried to be patient with niggas that ain't right
Give 'em game they couldn't take niggas ain't it
Rate me one out of ten they gon' say ten
Who that bad bitch on camera, let bae in
Who that is back to back hope that's baby
Can't do no shows he for stadiums
I like my Lamborghinis 'cause they drive fast
But the Maybach that's prolly my favorite whip
I'm in the back seat with my feet up reclined
Getting my dick rolled like the Mercedes Benz
And I pop big shit so I don't check when they talking
If you dish shit out, you gotta take it in
I be like hold up

Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie up (Park it)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it
Red light, green light
Bitch, okay, uh
Oh oh oh oh okay

I'm back on that big homie up
Hop out the coupe with that shit on me
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on it
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Red light, green light"
