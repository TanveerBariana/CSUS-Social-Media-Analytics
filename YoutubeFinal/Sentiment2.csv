0,[Music] it's so talented right so do you see yeah yeah trained for five minutes guys welcome welcome to our Witcher quick non-spoiler review no spoilers if you want spoilers if you played the games if you know about the books or you just want to watch a cool ass discussion that's very very long watch our spoiler review don't watch this one this one we're gonna go over it very very quick we're gonna miss some things so watch that one but this is for the casuals who want to enjoy the series and we highly recommend that you go out and see it so I kind of reveal the way I feel about it I freaking love it give big surprise big huge surprise I know it you knew that was coming I love The Witcher series on Netflix now it's not without its flaws yes I will say that I'm not that blind I'm not that big of a fan boy and I will fanboy out over this I real it Henry Cavill as Guerra Lee [ __ ] kills it what you have to nail in The Witcher is you have to nail Geralt of Rivia the white wolf he [ __ ] nails it not only that but the [ __ ] swordplay in this is so goddamn good it's done actually helped choreograph by the night King the person that plays the night king in the Game of Thrones series anyways he even used the art sign go ahead I loved it I thought it was really good and I think wow so I'm a little bit biased maybe not as biased as you are but I did love the game's familiar with some of the stories I I thought it was really good I think there was some flaws I think that they took some interesting amazing interesting decisions and how they were gonna tell the story like you have some like weird converging timelines yes so there were some problems with that but I think they sink Pacey's an issue yeah if you're not a big one it's a information Overlord overload well then the other issue is like we talked about like a little bit the names in this universe can be very difficult so it's a Earl and Joe and Bob and so you know Bob the wizard sometimes they'll mention a name you're like which which of the seven fears did we sometimes mention a name you like is that the 7 year old version of that guy or the 8 year old version which is also to say look to say the same character so she's like items locations kingdoms relationships but I loved it I think they did a great job telling the story I thought that the I wasn't worried about yennefer uh but turned out that I didn't need to be worried she kills it did a great job I think ciri that that actress did a great job for a twelve-year-old version of Siri I think it was perfect right remember this is a young version of Siri I know the internet was a little and I want this 20 year old right like smoky eye is [ __ ] awesome seriously no man she's got to go through a character arc and in this one I will admit though Siri is the weakest of your three arcs that are going on because and and there's a reason why they told the story in the way they told it yes it still makes it weak or yes it still loses my family members and my friends - these guys what the [ __ ] is going on with these who please just watch please guys just watch at least through episode three you know what I don't just watch them all because it clicks what by the end don't be on your phone don't be attention you have to pay attention maybe rewatch them a once Joe what did you think I loved it my two standouts were obviously geralt and yennefer yeah she killed it yeah in fact it arguably this is not Geralt series it's Jennifer Jennifer is basically the main character here and you know what makes me a little mad considering who I'm dressed as who I wanted to see most you can dress you up as her yeah a little bit that's Joe's job okay thank you will be the Unicorn a series of a stuffed horse anyways yeah I really enjoyed this I've actually been watched it all at once because I was watching it with my family and they kept going who's that when are we we're in different timelines it's not that complicated to handle and honestly there's a reason for it because the way they adapted the books you have to understand these these books like the last wish is a collection of short stories and sort of destiny in much the same way ciri and yennefer don't really fit into those until the very end and what they wanted to show you is all three of the main characters all at once and so in order to do that they had to do different timelines but by doing that because Siri doesn't have much until at the group gets together and then she's developed it feels like her storyline stalls and whenever we go back to her as I uh there's a forest part with the dryads and you know but Janna first story so powerful her her tragic upbringing you know her being sold off to you know the Academy and stuff like this and you know I'm trying to stay away from spoilers but she has this fantastic transformation into the yennefer that we know Jennifer you have to get right if you [ __ ] up yennefer and you [ __ ] up Geralt you the whole series as by the end by the end both of them nail it and you know the the swordplay is awesome the CGI is gray scenery the music the scenery the music we love the music because it reminds us of the games I was dancing that you know this [ __ ] in Poland and I wonder how this series is going over in Poland I want to see real polish people tell me if you're a Polish tell me what you thought of the series because your opinion matters more okay cuz this is this not serious this is the Lord this kind of Lord I love it because all these fascinating creatures and monsters you don't normally see what more can you see a few but they have their own lore and mythology and they nail that here a lot of people say oh there's not enough monsters I counted them there's like 10th wreaking monsters there's plenty and they were woven into the story they have to stay true to the books they're doing a book adaption not a video game adoption but you could have probably centered on Geralt a little bit more than they did yeah and I just loved it when Henry Cavill was on screen yeah I think that the action was was what I wanted right because we were expecting a lot of swordplay big big battles between armies some armies I didn't like how they were dressed but you know it was it was it was still worth watching I think this is something you definitely want to seek out okay um you know were there any what what are some of the weakest moment we tell you everything we like moment obviously we all agree pacing pacing was all over the place Trish yeah Triss Merigold it's such a she was miscast but she was such a small part of that I mean she she's a big part in the game she is but second season we probably see more verse of she has to win me over right yeah here's the thing I want to talk about something I'm not allowed to talk about and I'll talk about this in the spoilers review too it's just the beauty kind of thing the angle these are very beautiful mages and they make themselves more beautiful and and so that has to deal it and but and and the transformation that yennefer goes and is amazing yennefer is absolutely you know beautiful by the end of the series is pushed into the background she's not be that I know Triss Merigold from from the video games red head you know [ __ ] awesome character design and clothing and I guess it's more like the books because she really wasn't a huge part of it but I just wish they would have buffed up a roll knowing that you know bunch of fans like the first time I saw her I thought that was just a maid in the background yeah so that's the only character that we feel wasn't done justice and whether it was you know miscast or whether it was this girl has it in her and we just need to see it in season two I don't know but that one was a major setback what is another major setback that is also a hilarious setback deflate looks tired ruined the North Gardens for me because every time I saw was I got a got-damn here comes a nut sacs yeah they're big [ __ ] scrotum nuts ow and second if Guardian Armour yeah not only did they [ __ ] up the armor but they helmets are literal [ __ ] [ __ ] they're it's it's a dick no he didn't ruin it the showrunner ruined at the costume designer who by the way yennefer x' costumes are amazing all the majors come they pay they pay homage to the video games and and in the book descriptions it's [ __ ] awesome Geralt costume straight out of the games straight out of the books amazing they [ __ ] up on the nilfgaardian out whether that is budgetary concerns and they couldn't get the actual badass looking black and gold they say black and gold there's not black and gold it's just black and ball sacks yeah there's gold on their [ __ ] banners but every time this army is marching around I'm laughing my ass off and I'm like these guys they don't look intimidating and that is the main thing about the army of the black they're intimidating and it's and it's terrible yeah so you [ __ ] up they're a whole point negative and I've argued with the showrunner on Twitter about about this we had our spat and I mentioned that please change the armor but now after seeing it there's like no way to change the armor there was so they made so many of those yeah there's so many in the errors in there so that really is one of the only weakness is that in the way the story is told the plot line can lose people you get simultaneous info dumps but not enough information of the geopolitics and where things are at so you know who's who and whose inner playing with who and weight as the major skill from the Brotherhood for his are the female mange is different from the male mages are they all called the Brotherhood or the Academy I'm a little you know it gets crazy but you know the show has its own standout moments like you know the academy scene and what actually happens with the the major Nishat sin that that's a really cool scene and then of course it wraps up in a final climactic battle that's worth the price of admission the battle of saw so something hill-hill sodden hill I think just worth it stick it through to the end guys let's go with our final ratings to make this a short video so you can watch our full spoiler review in just a bit I'm gonna give this an 8 really yeah I was expecting a 7 why an angel because of Henry cobbles bathtub scene have been mighty a little bit biased yeah he did a great job he nailed the character this is a definitive Geralt kill or people who haven't played the games cuz you know obviously it does seem like he's kind of doing a girl impression I heard that he wore out his armor four times because his muscles were so big that doesn't make much sense cuz it's leather but maybe the straps would just break every time with legs anyways jennipher man beautiful awesome character arc was amazing like every time she was on the scene I was like blue she did a perfect job and Trish lost me and like I said the pacing was kind of off but I loved the monsters whenever they were on screen they did a great job of the CGI in the scenery okay I'm also gonna go with an 8 I think they told from the start to finish there was like a cohesive story there was a little messing up along the way as far as like how they paced it out and like the the things going back and going who the hell are all these things sure you were gonna be the hardest on it oh I mean there were there were some parts that I didn't agree with but I think that they they accomplished what they set out to do they did the characters that I know and love justice for the most part and you know the action was good I mean it did lose some points here and there for like the way they told the story in different things that I don't think we're perfect but but I really enjoyed it but I think this this has shows so much promise that I cannot wait your next season because this this reminds me of a lot of great other TV where the first season they're just kind of seeing what works but there's some standout things like the leads are all amazing I think the lore and the the background story is amazing and if they continue to flush that out this could be just something I enjoy watching year after year definitely there's a lot of potential for a lot of seasons the showrunner says I could bright eight eight season seven seasons every month and there's plenty of material there's like eight books maybe nine if you count no I think there's like eight solid ones and and so it for me it's going to be there's the critic or the fan eight out of ten because you know I could see some people giving this a 7 yeah some of my family members were so lost and I could tell that they were like glass eye and they're six but by the end it all clicked together and and it was so worth it and they were saying wow that was great by the end and it's like I wish they would have told her different so maybe if they hadn't have rushed the three simultaneous storylines and we just stuck with Jarrell for a while and then maybe Jennifer is season 2 you know if they had more time but you know what I understand the need to come out swinging to come out and hit as hard as you possibly can and they felt like they needed all three character arcs right there and it worked because honestly it got a second season the hype for it is is high and I think that like Alex says this could be TNG you know the next generation Star Trek season one yeah they miss a lot and then it gets real good you know right a long time it's real good yeah and so I'm hoping that that will be the similar situation here guys The Witcher on Netflix we love it we support it it has its flaws but you can get over those flaws quite easily because of the performances and the character arcs and the short stories on by the author just a fantastic little fun little fairytale fantasy of this this great universe in mythos of The Witcher done well here on Netflix 8 out of 10 and if you want we're gonna expand we're gonna go through each and every episode we're gonna talk about the monsters and where they could go with season two and our spoilers review thank you so much for watching and we'll see you guys on the next and Greedo bye guys ,0.22900018601190492,0.5425928509424606,0.065,0.738,0.197,0.9999
