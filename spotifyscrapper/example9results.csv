    2 ContributorsA Guide to Growing Up - Level 2 (The World Around You) Lyrics(How to Annotate This Tex...","Change in Friends

There is no such thing as a happy ending (except in certain massage venues). But while great tragedy brings people closer together, times of minor stress drive people apart. Go figure. Friendships are forged over collaborations, common interests, and sometimes just being in the same place at the same time. We each have a life path that is pre-defined for us, or that we carve out ourselves, from the surrounding thicket. Pathways are shared on a temporary basis. They cross, intertwine, encapsulate, and some even run parallel for awhile. It’s during this time that people can form a friendship.

Let’s say you are seated next to a stranger on a roller coaster. The shared thrill sparks a bond between you two and you decide to spend the rest of the day together in the theme park. A friendship is shared… but how long will it last? At the end of the day, it’s discovered you live in far opposite directions of the park. Would it be wise to put much emotional stock in this person you just met? Maybe it would be best to be grateful for the time you had and not put much pressure on yourself, or one another, to continue to grow closer. Hmm, isn’t college like that also—one big amusement park, with people from everywhere? If you haven’t yet noticed how temporary your high school relationships are, college is much of the same. Enjoy things while they’re there. With the taskforce in place that will be discussed later, you won’t be in bad shape.
Sometimes, friendships come along that are just too much fun to part with without a struggle. Consider yourself lucky when this happens. Having a companion to share lots of experiences with can be great, but just because you spend a lot of time with one person, doesn’t necessarily mean that you have a good friendship. People must be allowed to grow apart and not be held back by bonds and wishes that no longer serve their best interest. While it’s sad to not have that familiar face around as much (or at all), it opens up a seat next to you for someone better right now. It’ll be ok.

Much of your time will be spent making new friends. A lot of the people will be nice, as they are looking to make new friends too. In deciding who to be friends with, you can’t let loneliness or anything else obscure your standards. You must remember that even if someone seems nice, they’re still people who have flaws. They have a lot of growing to do as well, for they are in a state of transition also. Be open, but don’t trust anyone with your life (or your money) just yet.

Look for other characteristics in a person, other than just how they treat you, to determine if they are trustworthy or not. Look for signs of honesty in tough situations. Do they care enough, and know how to care well enough, or are they too apathetic?


Role of Acquaintances

You’re essentially friendly strangers. You might share mutual friends or spend a lot of time at the same place. Interaction consists of a nod or polite hello, but conversation only reaches the “how are you” point if you’re both together alone for longer than five seconds, like waiting for an elevator. If you were to suddenly share personal information, or inquire about them personally, it may seem awkward. You have no obligation to them whatsoever, though if they are in trouble and you ignore them as you might a real stranger, they could harbor resentment. It is expected that you will be friendly and welcoming at all times, because your relationship is not strong enough to withstand one act that could be received as being offensive. While you might tell a close friend you’re not in the mood to talk right now, you’ll more than likely listen to this person rant if they feel so inclined to use you as a sounding board while you wait for your laundry to finish. Acquaintances sees only your best face, because you are not comfortable enough around them to reveal any feelings or vulnerabilities. You’re always fine, calm, and in control of yourself when they are around. Examples of acquaintances: Co-workers, people who take the same bus all the time, classmates, people in your dorm (not roommates), the waitress in a restaurant you frequent, neighbors (in some places, neighbors act like friends), people you add on Facebook but never actually message or talk to in person, distant cousins/in-laws, and new people you are introduced to at parties.

When you find someone very similar to yourself or someone whose personality you can't get enough of, you tend to feel very comfortable around them. You both open up and share personal feelings, dreams, desires, and experiences. The person you have this type of bond with is known as your confidant, your friend.


Role of a Friend

The main goal of being someone’s friend is to enhance their happiness and enjoyment, while they symbiotically do the same for you. For instance: Friends don’t let friends watch new episodes of Saturday Night Live (basically anything post-Will Farrell). Friends visit you in the hospital, saying, “That was totally awesome!”  Friends help each other move, for the small compensation of beer and barbeque/pizza. Friends lend one another their cars. A friend will give you a ride within forty miles without asking for gas money (though the friend needing the ride should always offer). Friends will listen to one another’s personal problems and try their best to offer advice. If they don’t have any advice, they will at least be sympathetic and supportive. Good friends can fool around in the bedroom for a good time. Unlike acquaintances,  friends are people you actually trust. They have demonstrated loyalty to you, by prioritizing a strong friendship over adventures and experiences that could damage it. For example, friends will not hit on your significant other. If you and said significant other should break up, they will not seek your ex out and try to establish a relationship of their own. But if for some reason your friend thinks your ex is someone they want to be with, your friend must ask your permission first, before attempting anything with your ex. As long as you do not still have strong feelings still for this ex, you should not prevent them from being happy together. If you do have strong feelings still, say “Not yet” and ask for more time to move on. A real friend will prioritize your friendship that’s already there over an unknown wild card that could end up not working either. A real friend will lie to authorities, even under oath, or they will simply refuse to testify. A good friend is someone you can make fun of constantly, and who makes fun of you, and no one ever gets hurt feelings because they know it’s not serious (or that you’re loved anyway).

Good Times

You need these. Don’t grow up old and joyless like a traffic court bailiff.  If you haven’t found your own niche and actually need this spelled out, here’s the gist of what’s common:

Parties, kick-backs, movies, concerts, road trips, sleepovers, dates, double-dates, sporting events, local band shows, theater, art galleries, taking classes just for general interest, going out to dinner, or to coffee, or hookah, going for walks, trying new foreign cuisine, wine-tasting, attending business conferences and acting like you care, sitting around the mall watching people and making up fake stories about them, student government, community service, building shit out of Legos, mentoring, volunteering, hanging out at bookstores, going to the beach, riding dirt bikes in the desert, hiking through the mountains, water-skiing on a lake, learning to play your guitar better, or another instrument…

Oh yeah, drinking and drugs are pretty popular too. If you’re going to go that route, at least be smart and selective about it. If you’re not sure about trying something, just watch first. Observe other people high on the drug you’re curious about and see if that’s a state of mind you still want to experience. Don’t accept handouts from just anybody. You never know if what you’re getting is really what they say it is or if it’s laced with something else. You don’t need to try everything. The side effects of being involved with certain people and certain drugs may result in a death wish. Stay away from anything addictive or too insane, like cocaine, meth, and heroin. As with anything, always consider the long-term effects of your decision, not just the short-term elation. If you get busted for having drugs or underage drinking (over 18), your mind will be blown how seriously society frowns upon your decision.


Mistakes You Need to Make

You need to go out with someone who mistreats you, hopefully not too badly, and not for too long. You just need to know what it’s like so you can actually appreciate it when someone is nice to you, instead of being turned off by it. The point of dating and relationships is not the chase. It’s being able to open up and actually feel connected to someone else. People who are enamored with the chase and lose interest once they have what they sought, will always feel unfulfilled until they die, stupid and alone.

You need to try something you know is a bad idea. This is the time to experiment and get all your curiosity and wildness out. If you want to drink, get high, pursue sexual fantasies, explore strange world views or religions… do it now (as opposed to when you have built a family) while you can make a new group of friends within a day after embarrassing yourself horribly in front of your old friends.

You need someone to be pissed off at you so you can learn to make adjustments to yourself. First and foremost, being defensive and snotty when confronted is a large sign of insecurity. Most people are insecure when it comes down to it. You have to at least believe in your own ability to change and adapt, or you might as well die now. There is nothing more fundamentally important than that. Unless you have unlimited funds, the person you are now will not make it in the real world, no matter how smart or experienced you already are.

You need to experience loss. The loss of a friend, getting a terrible grade, the loss of a contest, something… and then you need to learn how to get over it. Recovery from losing depends on what kind of loss it is. Always remember that life itself goes on no matter what–even if yours doesn’t, even if someone else’s doesn’t. Time keeps on going, healing, forgetting… A loss just makes an opening for something else in your life. A renewed dedication for yourself to be better is always a good place to start. You can always be good enough but you can never be great enough. In the middle, somewhere is a healthy self-image. Remember to grade yourself on a curve, compared to those around you. You can’t strive for perfection as a person. In academics and other systems with clearly defined parameters, it’s possible, but not for people, because all our rules are subjective. Just be the best version of yourself you can be, in any given situation, and hopefully people won’t loudly despise you. That’s really the best anyone can do.

You need to realize what your mistakes are and then remember not to make the same ones over again. Making a mistake is not a failure. Failure is continuing to make the same mistakes instead of making progress. If you’re hanging out with the same kind of people, dating the same kind of people, doing the same kind of activities, and not getting the desired results you want… maybe you just don’t belong where you think you do, like people who try to find love in bars, for instance. People go to bars to have a good time and laugh. Lurking around are the few that just don’t get it: Those just out to get laid for the night, those who are looking for their soul-mates, and occasionally, a few looking to cause a lot of trouble after the bar closes.


Mistakes That are Costly to Make

Don’t jump to extreme conclusions. If you are mistreated or angered by someone of a certain race, ideology, or some other sort of classification, do not condemn all other people who fit that same category. No one person is a complete representative of their culture or race. Hate the person who hurt you, but not everything that reminds you of that person. Even though the reminders might hurt you again for awhile, hating them is retarded. Don’t decide not to date hockey players, or blondes, or automotive engineering majors. Those are all the wrong classifications. The only classification you need to keep away from are the douchebags.
Don’t sign up for the credit card offers that will mysteriously start flowing in. They are just trying to take advantage of your energetic ignorance and add you to the majority of debt-ridden Americans. However, our society is so credit-driven, you now NEED a credit card for any sort of travel or financial agreement (rent, etc.). A good credit score will take you more places than actual cash will. Most hotels require a credit card in order to check in. Almost all rental car services require one as well. Credit cards are even used now to check into airlines.
Debit cards aren’t always treated the same. Also, hotels/car rental services will put large “holds” on the card which could actually be a problem on a debit card. Talk with your parents (if your parents suck, try the school guidance counselor) about what kind of credit card to start out with. The rules for using credit cards are not to buy anything on it that you don’t currently have the cash to pay off. Pay it off immediately online. Try not to use it at all except in the case of emergencies… However, make sure your card isn’t one of the tricky ones that will actually charge you for NOT using it.

Don’t drop a class without actually dropping it at the registration office. An incomplete or a W is a lot better than an F. Don’t fuck yourself over by being lazy or embarrassed for not wanting to stick it out.


Unwritten Rules of Social Interaction (until now)

There are many things that are just “understood” that no one ever thinks to tell you about until you mess up… Sometimes, they still won’t even tell you. They’ll just think you’re an idiot (or an asshole) and not respect you anymore. This is a very incomplete list of things expected of you. First and foremost: Rules are only a guideline to follow for the goal of general peace. General peace is not always the objective. Rules also become obsolete over time and need to be amended.

If you drink, you are expected to be the one who buys sometimes. Buying a drink for a stranger who is broke is not uncommon. Sharing your alcohol with friends/roommates is mandatory. But always leave the last beer or ¼ of a bottle of alcohol to the person who bought it.

Rotate designated drivers. Just because one person might not drink as much as the rest of you, they still should get to drink sometimes.

If you smoke, you are expected to give a spare cigarette to any other smoker who asks for one. When you are out of cigarettes, they are expected to give one to you. Offering money for just one makes you look very lame and desperate. Just ask nicely. Unless their pack is almost empty, most people will comply.

When doing drugs, ask any people you’re around if they are comfortable with you doing it in front of them. Some people can get in a retarded amount of trouble if they come home smelling like weed. There’s such a thing called guilt by association (which is not justice at all, but justice in America is a joke anyway), which can get people around you who had nothing to do with it in just as much trouble (or more, if on probation), if an authority were to catch you. Plus, if you don’t know that someone is uncomfortable, they could always rat you out (or tell someone else who rats you out).

Do not hook up with, or ask out, or have an affectionate relationship of any kind with the ex of a friend or family member. If you wish to, ask the permission of your friend or family member first; unless they are still in love (or just crazy), they should feel obligated to give you their permission.

If you become best friends with your sibling’s ex or ex-best friend, there will likely be problems. Just expect it.

It’s hard to be honest about things that will hurt someone. But to save further and deeper hurt later, you should tell the truth anyway, even if
it makes you look bad. Not enough people do this. If you have any courage at all, at least admit to things you do. It’s easier for a person to forgive any other mistake than it is to trust someone who has lied to them.

Don’t talk on your cell phone in libraries, elevators, or other enclosed spaces with other people. No one cares to hear your conversation about how your friend is getting a tramp stamp of  Drake making out with the Rihanna tattoo on Chris Brown’s neck.
When at parties, at least make small talk to people you are introduced to by the host.

Pay attention to your body language. Being quiet doesn’t make you immune from the judgment of others.

If you are inviting people along to an outing, make it clear whether you are paying for them or if they need to pay for themselves. You don’t have to directly state ‘but I’m not paying for you’. That makes you sound like a dick. If during the course of conversation you just state ‘tickets are $60’ or what not, then it’s implied that person needs to come up with that money.

Backing out of plans at the very last minute is bullshit. If it’s an emergency, then people will understand, but you better be the one to call and tell them. Don’t call and don’t show up more than once, and you can forget that friendship forever. At some point in the future, it will be legal to set these fuckholes who flake out all the time on fire.

If you have horrendously nasty farts, go somewhere else. It’s not even funny the first time. Seriously. No funny footnote. Just go away.

When you lend someone money, have a date set for them to pay you back. If you are the one borrowing money, don’t wait for the lender to ask for it back. It’s really uncomfortable for some people to ask for it.

If you borrow something, return it in the same condition. Under no circumstances, are you allowed to lend out something you yourself borrowed without asking the person who actually owns it first.

Girls with tattoos on their back or chest are generally not taken seriously. Angelina Jolie’s tiger and claw marks look cool. You’re not Angelina Jolie. Same with guys who have tattoos on their biceps of: barbed wire, tribal markings with no actual significance, random Chinese characters, or sports team logos. Guys with tattoos on their neck, or who have tattoos of more than one woman’s name on them, are guys most people want to stay away from. Maybe they’re harmless, but the more you modify your body, the tougher normal life will become.

Guys should always expect to pay for the date, even though it happens less and less these days. Especially the first date.

If you dress like a whore, you will be treated like a whore. Just like if you dress like a gangster, you could be jumped or shot. That’s just the way it is, and taking a stand against this isn’t going to make a change. It’s just going to hurt you. Until people as a whole are not superficial and fearful, judging people by how they look and dress will always be a problem. Aren’t we silly?

Always pick up after yourself. Especially at someone else’s house. Don’t leave your used drinks or plates lying around. At least put them in the sink and rinse them.

If going somewhere far away with a group of friends, offer the person driving a little bit of money for gas (usually $5 is fine).

If you’re in a group of more than two people, don’t walk side by side where other people need to get by you (the mall, movie theaters, skating rinks, etc.). Or if you do, at least move fast.

If you’re going to be late, call as soon as you realize it. If you’re going to be more than ten minutes late, call at the time you were supposed to arrive and give an update on your status.

When living with roommates, be very clear on what is shared and what you don’t want other people to use. Things go by smoother if either everything is shared or nothing is shared.

People will hate you if you try to fight battles for someone else. Not minding your own business doesn’t make you a hero; it makes you a pest.
Once you introduce friends to one another, you can’t step in and try to keep them separate; especially if they become friends with one another.

When you drop a hint about something, and a person doesn’t get it the first time, say what you mean very bluntly in a whisper, or write it on a note. Otherwise the person may ask out loud what the hint you gave means, and you’ll both be embarrassed.

People who blare their music loudly from their cars with the windows down are ALL douchebags. What you think is good music, probably isn’t. The only exceptions are Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Tupac.

When someone comes into your place, offer them something to drink, especially if they’re there to do repair work. They’re likely to do better work if they’re hydrated and then you leave them alone. Don’t stand by watching them work.

If your kid is crying in a restaurant, theater, or any other public establishment, pick them up and take them outside. Or better yet, if the kid isn’t mature enough (regardless of age) to not cry unless physically injured somehow, don’t bring them along at all. If you’re a young parent, your life as you once knew it is now over, and you need to accept it.

Don’t drag friends along shopping (especially window shopping!) if they hate shopping. They will rightfully hate you.

There is no good reason to tape the birth of anything. Is there ever a good reason to go back and watch the birth of something? No. Also, nobody cares about ultrasound pictures. How are people supposed to react? “Oh, it’s a peanut. Aren’t you lucky…”

Don’t show pictures of babies to guys. For that matter, don’t show real babies to guys either. When they’re old enough to play catch or tackle football, only then will the friendly reaction be genuine.

All nude pictures WILL get circulated around the internet. Yes, yours too.

Unless you’re in amazing shape, don’t wear cutoff shirts or booty shorts, regardless of your age. Stretch marks and fat rolls get the same reaction as if you have boogers dripping down your face.

When people are sleeping, be fucking quiet! Unless they have told you to wake them up at a certain time, don’t wake them up by being noisy just because you’re awake.

Always knock when there is a closed door. At the same time, if you don’t want someone coming in, lock the door. If we all work together on this, we might have at least marginal success.

Easy on the cologne, stupid! It reeks of overcompensation. Spray one time, directly in front of you, then walk through it once. That’s all you need.


Bonus Level !!

How do you differentiate between noise and valuable information? Do you only accept what topics interest you? Or, do you only listen to what (publicly accepted) reliable sources have to say? With the selective fact-sharing that goes on nowadays, how do you analyze what information is credible, and what is merely propaganda?

What are the downfalls of letting your emotions make decisions for you? Conversely, what are the downfalls of not factoring your emotions into your decisions at all?

How do you rank the following, in terms of importance: Happiness, doing what’s right, balance, experience, knowledge? How do you justify one aspect over the other? Does it ever flip-flop?

Do you understand the concept of free will and being in charge of your life, or are you too used to being a sheep and having others tell you/force you into doing what they say? How do you intend to break free from slavery (that’s literally what it is)? If it’s not as easy as just saying no, devise a plan to be able to become free.

The more you expect from a person, the more opportunities there are for you to be disappointed. Can you live life with only acquaintances around? Don’t you have a longing for a closer connection with at least a few other people?

When you envision the person you want to be, what do you see? How is that person different from you now? Do you already have a roadmap of changes and pathways necessary for you to get there, or do you need to make one?

We all want to live life to the fullest… but what is that, really? Is it never settling for anything less than the best, or is it indulging in every opportunity that comes our way? Is what you picked actually how you act and what you base your values on?

At what point is it a good idea to trash a current relationship? At what point is a relationship already in the trash worth fighting to keep?

Do you still see a difference between news and entertainment? If you blur the two together, it seems like it could be used as an unfathomable mind-control device, instructing the emotional response of viewers. What are the dangers and benefits of this?Embed"

Has lived there for years and he makes me sing this way
I set up a bed down by the steps
So when I run down stairs, I don't crash and smash my head
I really have to pee now but I can not leave because
I’m waiting for Rihanna
Where is that ho?
This is our girl's night
I sent her an e-vite
To have a slumber party, party, at my house

[Chorus: Tatiana Owens as Shakira]
Ohh, I'm very frio, I keep forgetting to put clothes on
Rock ’n' roll, guitar solo, I had to start a band with no-one
The evil throat froggy
He put a curse on me, now I must live in this big house alone
Hey Rihanna, where the hell are ya?
Don't piss me off or I'll unfriend you

[Verse 2: Tatiana Owens as Shakira & *Tatiana Owens as Rihanna*]
Sorry I'm late
I was harassed at the gate
Your house is a maze
Don't know why you need all this space
We're smoking in bed, bitchin' bout men
Our asses look great but we can’t find a decent mate
It really makes me feel bad
Got issues with my dad and it makes me date such assholes
Oh, not again
Let’s play a board game
Like Scattergories
And I will make us nachos, nachos
Where'd she go?

Now we’re dry humping the dry wall
Why can't I rebound from stupid Chris Brown?
You keep forgetting he's an assclown

[Bridge: Tatiana Owens as Shakira & Tatiana Owens as Rihanna]
I'd kill and I’d steal and I'd cheat on my taxes
And french kiss a frog for that boy (really?)
I'd eat a fart sandwich and lie down in traffic
He battered you like a Nerf toy
I have a solution, a man substitution
Have you met my friend, the bullfrog?
Just reach down and kiss him
He'll become a prince and
He won't treat you like a lap dog

[Chorus: Tatiana Owens as Shakira & Tatiana Owens as Rihanna]
Ohh no, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Now the evil frog has cursed you
What is that noise? That's your new voice

How do I stop this hell? This vocal prison cell?
You have to pass the curse to someone else
Well this is goodbye, my hips don't lie
You kind of sound like Julie AndrewsEmbed"

Rihanna, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Justin Bieber
Wiz Khalifa, Bruno Mars y Lil Wayne se la viven
Indios en el Amazonas, hasta el de Mi Pobre Angelito
A toditos ellos los vieron fumandose un porrito
Lady Gaga, Mylie Cyrus, Paris Hilton estan caidas
Paparazzis las pescaron con la varita encendida
Lindsay Lohan, Cameron Diaz, Angelina Jolie
Y la jevita del Crepúsculo tambien probaron weed
Brad Pitt, Charlie Sheen, Jhonny deep, Julio César Chávez
Dio positivo en una prueba por si no lo sabes
Empresarios, deportistas, actores de Hollywood
Y por supuesto el mas dragon de todos Snoop Doggy Dogg
Muchos si son cifragiales y hasta en aspectos legales
La reina de Inglaterra la uso pa aliviar sus dolores menstruales
En cambio el quimico que suelta el humo de fabricas industriales
Que es tan letal que altera el clima y causa secuelas ambientales
Esos si son los verdaderos criminales
Los que hay que abrirles casos en tribunales
Por ser los autores intelectuales
Por causar tantos males a la tierra a sus animales
Y por querer destruir una planta de propiedades espirituales
Sera su ignorancia desconocimiento sobre el tema
O es que al sistema no les conviene legalizarla
Como hay tanto intereses de por medio seria un problema
Un golpe bajo para ellos y por eso tienden a denigrarla
Pero que mas mi rey seguimos burlando la ley
Happy very happy es como no las pasamos every day
Como la face del muñequito que sale en el sobre de kool-aid
Positive my brain a grado alto forever high grade
A 60 cuadros chilling hi a velocidad nube
Viendo como el speed del green weed a tu cabeza sube
Concienticen y no crean en todo lo que por ahí se dice
Yo seguire haciendo estos temas hasta que el mundo la legalicen
(coro)
Dejame my high grade
Que la ganja es natural
Y tiene un uso medicinal
Dejame my high grade
Si no conviene su venta
Entonces denjenle sembrar
No difames my high grade
Su cultura es milenaria y ellos dicen que es ilegal
No conviene my high grade
Porque despierta tu mente de este mundo artificialEmbed"

[Verse: Example]
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Pre-Drop: Example]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Example]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Drop: Example]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Bridge: Example]
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

[Drop: Example]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds

I love the way I feel
Streets replaced with fields
Wide awake in here, you shine
I ran away from goals
Left you in the cold
Nothing's in our way tonight

[Chorus: Calvin Harris]
You know that you'll never be replaced
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me
And either way, our time won't go to waste
Our﻿ hearts will never be the same again
Our hearts will never be the same again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Ellie Goulding]
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Verse: Ellie Goulding]
Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love (love, love...)

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Ellie Goulding]
All the years, all the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free

So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass, just bottles
And I'm buying everybody one each

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow

Then everything is alright (Woo)

If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio

[Verse: Florence Welch]
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So, I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So, I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)

Oh, I see they mad, I see they mad at me
The jealousy is such a tragedy
I got a feeling that they after me
Cause I'm it, boy, but I swear to God, this ain't shit, boy
It's just light work
It's just light work
Light work
Light work

[Verse 2: Rittz]
I might hurt some feelings but fuck it, killin' the mic is light work
My rhymes are fight words
Suicide bomber when I’m on a cypher
You a Titanic, about to collide with an iceberg
If the sky is the limit, I’m supplying the fireworks
Grand finale and ain’t nobody smiling, I wipe smirks
Off motherfuckers' faces that be hating and I urge
My fans to do the same shit
Lame shit, talking, tell em they hardest rap ain’t fucking with my worst
Fuck following trends, I done decided to divert
Rappers blending in like Waldo inside of a striped shirt
Nothing standing out about them, same old shit as the others
They make me sick to my stomach and I feel like I might purge
Meanwhile I’m fly as hell sitting on my perch
My Chrysler 300 reeking just like purp
Got pulled over, searched, my girl done threw the cigarillo
I was drinking Crown, she had a gin and limoncello
They let us go and didn’t find the Xanny bars
I had 100 of em in my underwear, I sell em for the L O
My homie robbed them off of Migos out in Monticello
Had to pistol whip him, homie started swinging like Canelo
Alvarez, I’m the best, unoppressed, competition don’t exist
People will tell you Jonny Valiant is out of his mind
You talentless pile of shit, stylin' long hair hangin'
I don’t play no Ibanez
[?], Rittz is back
Serving these motherfuckers like I been in a tennis match
Diving inside a pool of money, come and swim a lap
I’m gonna multiply a bundle while you fend for scraps
Why you so tense? Relax, ho what you saying on your twitter man
Just making me think you want to hear the ginger snap
Swag rappers busy thumbing through the vintage racks
I’m getting money and it gets them mad
But let me at em cause it’s light work

[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
Oh, I see they mad, I see they mad at me
The jealousy is such a tragedy
I got a feeling that they after me
Cause I'm it, boy, but I swear to God, this ain't shit, boy
It's just light work
It's just light work
Light work
Light work

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, nigga this light work
I'm 'bout to go berzerk, make the mic hurt
Fuck the world, I don't like earth
This Mac-10 will put a hole in his white shirt
On some pimp shit, draped in white fur
I got a white ho that look like Pamela Anderson
She blow me in the back of an ambulance, bumping Marilyn Manson
I came from an era when niggas did crack and heroin
Up in the Netherlands, I get more head than Evelyn Lozada
I don't fuck with pigs, bitch I tell them I know nada
Hasta manana, I just wanna day to put my cock inside Rihanna
Been sleeping on the god all day, they in pajamas
Dodging these piranhas, party out in Ghana, smoking marijuana
I can feel em watching, know the enemies amongst us
I know I'm a monster, I just bought my son a Tonka
Truck, I still hit a bitch in front his mama
Yeah, someone get him a Kit-Kat
Click clack, pat pat
Bitch nigga get back
Might slap a fag with my kids in Six Flags
Don't smoke blunts, bitch, I roll zig-zags
Loud ass colors in my kicks like RiFF RAFF
Fuck swag, come up in this bitch so mismatched
Fuck the police, dispatch you get that?
Been at it all day, someone crack a six pack
Yeah, I don't like her, I one night her, and you wife her
A nigga paid in full like Mekhi Phifer
Shitting on these rappers, guess I'm gon' need a diaper
On more pharmaceuticals than Pfizer
I know I need help can someone call Kaiser
This is Jacob's ladder, you motherfuckers don't matter
This vodka damaging my bladder, I'm bout to eat me a rapper
That's light work3Embed"

Лучшая шалава меня греет, ведь мне можно
Плату, завершаю блантом
Если суке мало, то взорвём ещё по бланту
Если суке мало...

Блять, да просто не капай мне на мозги, когда я разговариваю с тобой нормально

Сука, как просто
Заработал мозгом и я сделал это просто
Можешь ли ты так же, повтори за мной счёт
Раз, два, три
Эти суки за мой счёт
Раз, два, три, просыпаюсь будто bless
Она хочет моих денег и пытается залезть
Только shake, shake, shake, тряси жопой как milkshake
Я не вижу твою buddy, пока на тебе есть шмот

(У) Пока на тебе есть шмот
Ни одна твоя проблема меня не ебет (Угу)
Будет полезно закрыть рот
И оставь меня в покое я ловлю вертолёт

Сука прыгает на мне

Mai dunya se naraaaz bhai, rakhe raaaz nai koi aaj mai furbaash bhai
Dil mai rakhen batt nai, ye lafz shyad aj pac nai, hatho hath ganay likhu rehte mujhe yaad nai
Urdu rap nazar band mujh pe aaj bhi
Mere liye kiu tu aaj bhi raaaten jaagti
Tu hi raaz jana, tu hi meri ajizi
Karne aya baat cheet, kahani bari dark thi
Phir bhi shine kare bhai jese Diamond
Tu Rihanna jese deti mujhe Time kam
Qaim hum, kiun lagaen jaa ke Time Bomb
Lafz tor deta kese parengay phir rhymes kam
Mere aagay kiun likharion k mind band
Mere aagay saaray labelon ki grind kam
Jis bhi gaanay pe ajata woh rewind par
Aaj bhi kehta hu maine music ko dia time kam
Kandhay pе bhoj, tanha betha mai tha sochraha
Gaanay likhu roz ke ya jorun jaa ke notе chaar
Parhle beta saving pe chalrahay hum berozgaar
Chora apna ghar, apna shehr, apne dost yaar
School maara bunk, Jokhay milne ata road paar
Dhabay walay tung, kha ke bhaagay bhi thay bohat baar
Tamashay ki umeed se na ana meri maut par
Rozi roti dene wala rabb, kiun le koi shortcut

On the rocks, trending charts k ab Top pe hum gaanay daalen bina promotion ke yehi ab nokri
Kamyaabi flex karu rhymes ki ye tokrii

Quiero que grites mi nombre y que cuando pregunte diga que eres mia

Paraíso de la pobreza
No creo que pueda encontrar una manera de hacerlo en esta tierra

[Correo de voz: Carl Duckworth]
¿Qué pasa familia?
Sí, es tu primo Carl, hombre, solo te estoy llamando, hombre
Sé que has estado teniendo mucho últimamente en mente
Y sé que te apetece, ya sabes
La gente no ha estado orando por ti
Pero tienes que entender esto, hombre, que somos un pueblo maldito
Deuteronomio 28:28 dice: ""El Señor te herirá con locura, ceguera y asombro de corazón""
Mira, familia, por eso sientes que sientes
Como si tuvieras un chip en tu hombro
Hasta que sigas sus mandamientos, te sentirás de esa manera–

[Puente: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar]
¿Por qué Dios, por qué Dios tengo que sufrir?
El dolor en mi corazón lleva cargas llenas de lucha
¿Por qué Dios, por qué Dios tengo que sangrar?

Te golpeo el culo si entras en esta casa

Tus profesores mejor que no se quejen de ti en clase
Esa pizza mejor que no se desperdicie, te comes todo

Esos Jordans mejor que no se ensucien cuando los compre
Será mejor que no escuche sobre ti follando a la hija de Keisha
Mejor no escuchar que te atrapaste

Moriré prolíficamente en estas fiestas house, follando con putas
Moriré prolíficamente por testigos dejándome falsamente acusado
Moriré prolíficamente pensando que yo y tu barrio eran geniales
O tal vez morir por presionar la línea, actuando demasiado extra
O tal vez morir porque estos fumadores están más que desesperados
Moriré prolíficamente de uno de estos murciélagos e insignias azules
Golpea el cuerpo con pintura en blanco y negro, mis huesos rompiéndose
O tal vez morir de pánico o morir estando demasiado relajado
O muere por esperarlo, morir porque me estoy moviendo demasiado rápido
Moriré prolíficamente tratando de comprar hierba en los apartamentos
Moriré prolíficamente tratando de calmar a dos amigos discutiendo
Moriré prolíficamente porque eso es lo que haces cuando tienes 17
Todas las preocupaciones a toda prisa, me gustaría controlar las cosas

Cuando tenía 27 años, me acostumbré a más miedo
Acumulado 10 veces a lo largo de los años
Mi nueva vida me hizo magnificar todo
¿Cuántos elogios necesito para bloquear la negación?
El valor de choque de mi éxito puso tornillos en mí
Todo este dinero, ¿Dios está jugando una broma para mí?
¿Es por el momento, y él me verá como Job?
¿Me lo quitas y me dejas peor de lo que era antes?
A los 27 años, mi mayor temor era perderlo todo
Asustado de gastar dinero, me hizo dormir de sala en sala
Asustado de volver a la Sección 8 con mi madre estresante
30 shows al mes y todavía no me compraré ningún Lexus
¿Qué es un asesor? Alguien que tiene mis cheques
¿Solo para joderme y poner mis finanzas en deuda?
Leí un caso sobre el contador de Rihanna y me pregunté
¿Cómo se sintió la Chica Mala cuando miró los números?
El tipo de mierda me hará saltar y simplemente matar algo
Perfora algo, enferma y llena trinquetes con algo pequeño
Practiqué huyendo del miedo, supongo que tuve buena suerte
A los 27 años, mi mayor temor era ser juzgado
Cómo me miran reflexionan sobre mí, mi familia, mi ciudad
Lo que dicen de mí revela si mi reputación me extrañaría
Lo que ven de mí goteará generaciones en el tiempo
Lo que escuchen de mí los hará resaltar mis líneas más simples

[Verso 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de perder la creatividad
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de perderte y perderme
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de perder la lealtad del orgullo
Porque mi ADN no me deja involucrarme en la luz de Dios
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de que mi humildad se haya ido
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de que el amor ya no viva aquí
Estoy hablando de miedo, miedo de que sea maldad o debilidad
El miedo, sea lo que sea, ambos son distintivos
Miedo, lo que sucede en la Tierra se queda en la Tierra
Y no puedo llevar estos sentimientos conmigo, así que espero que se dispersen
Dentro de catorce pistas, realizadas sobre cera
Buscando resoluciones hasta que alguien regrese
Miedo, lo que sucede en la Tierra se queda en la Tierra
Y no puedo llevar estos sentimientos conmigo, así que espero que se dispersen
Dentro de catorce pistas, realizadas sobre cera
Preguntándome si estoy viviendo el miedo o viviendo a traves del rap
Maldición

[Puente: Bēkon]
Dios te maldiga, Dios me maldiga
Dios nos maldiga, Dios nos maldiga
Dios nos maldiga a todos

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
El verso 2 dice: ""Solo he conocido a todas las familias de la Tierra, por lo tanto, los castigaré por todas sus iniquidades""
Así que hasta que volvamos a estos mandamientos
Hasta que vuelvas a estos mandamientos
Nos sentiremos de esta manera, estaremos bajo esta maldición
Porque dijo que nos va a castigar
Los llamados negros, hispanos e indios nativos americanos
Son los verdaderos hijos de israel
Somos los israelitas, según la Biblia
Los hijos de israel
Nos castigará por nuestras iniquidades, por nuestra desobediencia
Porque elegimos seguir a otros dioses
Ese hombre castiga a su hijo, así el Señor, tu Dios, te castiga
Así que, al igual que castigas a tu propio hijo, Él te castigará
Porque Él te ama, por eso somos castigados
Por eso estamos en la posición en la que estamos
Hasta que volvamos a estas leyes, estatutos y mandamientos
Y haz lo que el Señor dice, estas maldiciones estarán sobre nosotros
Vamos a estar en un estado inferior en esta vida que vivimos
Aquí, en la actualidad, en los Estados Unidos de América
Te amo familia y rezo por ti
Dios te bendiga

Skits weren't considered, either (condolences to all the Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the live Grammy performance of ""Stan"" or The Slim Shady EP's ""Just the Two of Us.""

'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

[Verse 1: Rihanna & will.i.am]
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

Skits weren't considered, either (condolences to all the Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the live Grammy performance of ""Stan"" or The Slim Shady EP's ""Just the Two of Us.""

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it

I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Take it to the tele and make her a victim

They shake the spot, she's just another case

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It's the way it's gotta be

[Chorus]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

[Outro]
Yeah, no, no
Now I know
