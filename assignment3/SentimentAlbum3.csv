0,0,IDGAF (feat. Yeat),"Traveling forever in the dark
Darkness into blackness
There and back, it's always black
Oh-ah, it screeched across the sky
Nothing to do but lie
Fuck the bitch, I make her sweat, huh, I'ma die by my respect, huh
I put a check up on my neck, life check ya in the head
I signed for a couple milli', you only touched a hundred thou'

Man, I don't give a fuck who it is
I called up my twizz' (BNYX)
Don't give a fuck what y'all on
Man, fuck all of you (All of you)

Yeah, I don't be givin' no fucks (Not one), uh (Just pull up, pull up, woah)
I don't know if you caught on (Caught on)
I don't be givin' no fuck (Huh)
I say whatever I want, yeah, I do whatever I want, huh
I'm countin' up money for fun
And I'm poppin' these Percs just for fun (Luh geek)

Look, comin' live from the
Comin' live from the one after five
Comin' live from the three, two time
Whole gang fucked her eastbound and they down just like Danny McBride
Why I always see your dawgs in the city?
Think your boys left some soldiers behind
Just like the J, you boys try to vibe
That ain't gon' fly, nope
I took that one off of the table
October's Own, it's a label
I stay with that O like a tie
I stay with that O like a bagel
I stay with that O like a lifesaver
Shout' to my ex, I'm her lifesaver
My Glocky, it sit on the night table
You light on the waist like a lightsaber
In Seattle, it's just me and Twizz'
I hate you boys more than I ever did
You rappin' 'bout shit that you never did
My dawg in the can like a metal lid
Free the kid, free the kid, free the kid

I don't be givin' no fucks (Not one), uh (Just pull up, pull up, woah)
I don't know if you caught on (Caught on)
I don't be givin' no fuck (Huh)

I'm countin' up the money for fun
And I'm poppin' these Percs just for fun (Luh geek)

All of my twizz' got a gun (Blam)
Couple of my twizz' on the run (Phew)
Couple of my twizz' sellin' Runtz (Luh geek)
Couple of my twizz' cut 'em up (Luh geek)
Yeah, couple of my twizz' sell a bunch
Heard your money got took like it's lunch (Hah)
We on the side and we punt
Bitch, I sleep in the day, I'on see sun (Uh-huh, yeah)
Big body Lamb' truck sittin' outside in the sun, it get you caught up, get you fried
You don't really have no swag, so what you did?
Your little buddy tried to take mine (Woo)
I never needed no help, I never needed nobody, I wait in no line (Woo)
Gonna be a minute, tell the time
If you did the crime, bitch, why you cryin'?
I just pulled up in a big body, I got a lot of money comin' in
I just got off the phone with my demon and he told me that I'm gon' win
I can't be wasting time on the 'net, I just be running up a fuckin' check
Fuck the bitch, I make her sweat, huh, I'ma die 'bout my respect, huh
I put a check up on my neck, life check ya in the head
I signed for a couple milli', you only touched a hundred thou'
Ain't nobody steal ya style, ain't nobody want yo' sauce
Tell me who the fuck gon' fall off, tell me who gon' make it out?

I don't be givin' no fucks (Not one), uh (Just pull up, pull up, woah)

1,1,First Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole),"[J. Cole:]
(Pew, pew-pew)
First person shooter mode, we turnin' your song to a funeral
To them niggas that say they want offices, you better be talkin' my work in cubicles
Yeah, them boys had it locked, but I knew the code
Lot of niggas debatin' my numeral, not the three, not the two, I'm the U-N-O
Yeah
Numero U-N-O
Me and Drizzy, this shit like the Super Bowl
Man, this shit damn near big as the-

[Drake:]
Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?
Big as the Super Bowl
But the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio
Niggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year old
I love a dinner with some fine women
When they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T
I'm like ""Go 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?
""Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.?""
""Who you bitches really rootin' for?""
Like a kid from January, then November, nigga, it's just you and Cole
Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?
Big as the Super Bowl

[J. Cole:]
Niggas so thirsty to put me in beef
Dissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep
I look at the tweets and start suckin' my teeth
I'm lettin' it rock 'cause I love the mystique
I still wanna get me a song with YB
Can't trust everything that you saw on IG
Just know if I diss you, I made sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID
I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me
Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come jot like a father to be
Love when they argue the hardest MC, is it K-Dot, is it Aubrey or me?
We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammed Ali
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammed Ali
Yeah, the one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT
Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake
The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake
It's like we recruited your homies to beat demon deacons, we got 'em a ten in the weight
Hate how the gang gotta wait for the bars, man, this shit like a prison escape
Everybody steppers, well fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)
When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster
The G.O.A.T. with the golden pin, the top toucher
The spot rusher, sprayed his whole shit up, the crop duster
Not Russia, but apply pressure
To your cranium, Cole's automatic when aimin' 'em
With The Boy in the status, a stadium
Nigga

[Drake:]
Ayy, I'm 'bout to, I'm bout to
I'm 'bout to, yeah
Yeah

I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm down to click down you hoes and make a crime scene
I click the trigger on the stick like a high beam
Man, I was Bentley wheel whippin' when I was nineteen
She call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned
She got an Android, her messages is lime green
I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines
And they send me naked pictures, it's just small things
You niggas is still takin' pictures on a dog stream
My youngers richer than you rappers and they all stream
I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams
Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing
Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not
They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot
They know The Boy the one that got a boycott
I told Jim and Jammer I use a GRAMMY as a door stop
Girl gave me some head because I need it
And if I fuck with you, then after I might eat it, wait
Niggas talkin' 'bout when this gon' be repeated
What the fuck bro? I'm one away from Michael
Nigga, beat it, nigga, beat it, what?

[Outro:]
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Don't even pay me back on no favors, I don't need it",0.034394841,0.5142038690476189,0.142,0.714,0.144,-0.8937
2,2,Virginia Beach,"I bet your mother would be proud of you, ooh (You, you, you, oh)
I bet our mother would be proud of you, oh
I know what you say
You say I coulda treated you better or whatever, but
I don't know, I think I did alright
Know what I'm sayin'?
And you know how you get
Drawin' conclusions like you got a Parsons degree or somethin'
I coulda treated you better, that's crazy
Nope

Lean in, lean in soda, Fanta, fantasizin'
That's not love you're in, it's more like compromisin'
I move mountains for you, fuck that social climbin'
Lean into me, lean into me
Yeah, lean in, lean into me

Pussy ain't makin' me tweak, ended up stayin' a week
She pretty but ghetto, pretty but rough, just like Virginia Beach
I wanna get back to the days that you loved me for nothin' but what you could see
You bust down the Jubilee, I swapped it and made you go factory, wait
You put some pain in me, I wanna get back to the major league
She wanna grab on the throttle, I wanna get back in the driver's seat
That nigga spent his last check on your car and you got it and drove it to me
Asked me if I coulda treated you better, but no

Lean in soda, Fanta, fantasizin'
That's not love you're in, it's more like compromisin'
I move mountains for you, fuck that social climbin'
Lean into me, lean into me
Lean in, lean into me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Grr, grr
Yeah

Our texts feelin' like a fencin' match, your temper shorter and I'm sensin' that
You keep talkin' 'bout some, ""Period,"" but where you 'bout to end the sentence at?
'Cause you been goin' off on my ass, then I tell your ass where I'm at
And you act like I'm not supposed to mention that
I introduce you to my friends' girlfriends, you ain't interested in makin' friends
Talkin' 'bout you wanna cook for a nigga in the kitchen, can you make amends?
Least we know you got the cakes on you, girl, you should prolly stick to bakin' then
Workin' this crop like the rubber chute, I swear that I'm not tryna smother you
I got to know a whole other you, but let's not forget how I discovered you
We ain't even gotta mention that, any nigga try and trouble you
He gon' find out that it's on-site like W-W-W
On site like dot-com, put a baby in you, a hot mom
Yeah, ask me if I coulda treated you better, but no
Not at all, not at all

I bet our mother would be proud of you, ooh (Mother would be proud)",0.10968364197530864,0.5253858024691359,0.093,0.723,0.184,0.9935
