0,i think it's fair to say that season one of the witcher didn't exactly set the world on fire when it premiered back in 2019 i mean it wasn't the worst thing in the world but it was a show that i could best describe as a diamond in the rough a compelling main character with an intriguing premise let down by haphazard world building a confused and convoluted narrative and an unnecessary focus on side characters that left the protagonist feeling like an afterthought in his own show all the right ingredients were definitely there but they didn't quite gel together into a satisfying end product but what the hell it was good enough for me to give it a second chance with season two after all plenty of shows get off to a rocky start before finding their feet and going on to better things and maybe that would be the case with the witcher so now that season two has been and gone has it actually learned its lesson well the short answer is yes and no it's definitely corrected some of the narrative problems that were so off-putting in season one and there's clearly been an attempt to frame the story in a wider context bringing in some of the all-important world building that was so lacking before but there's still some persistence problems [ __ ] and in order to understand the good and bad about this show allow me to illuminate you so the action picks up right after the climactic battle at the end of season one with the battle all but lost the sorceress yennefer used forbidden fire magic to destroy the invading nilfgaardian army apparently vaporizing herself in the process but then the story's like nah it'll be fine and she wakes up in the forest the next morning we've all been there last unfortunately she partied a bit too hard the night before and now she's lost her magic ability but before she can figure out what the [ __ ] just happened to her she gets captured by diverse female sorceress who then gets captured by strong female elf leader damn people just can't stop getting captured in this [ __ ] show then the three strong female characters go into an underground tunnel and have a vision of what they want most in life no not that this vision leads to an alliance between diverse female sorceress and strong female elf leader while yennefer learns that if she wants to get her magic back she has to track down siri and deliver her to an evil witch that got banished to a magical cabin on legs uh the evil witch wants to possess siri so she can open her portal back to her own dimension and use it to summon the wild hunt to [ __ ] things up for everyone speaking of which siri's finally been united with geralt who takes her to the witcher stronghold at cair morin so we can learn more about her and before you know it she's training to become a witcher by playing total wipeout and experiencing a series of spectacular fails seriously how can you [ __ ] up something as simple as this the more geralt learns about siri the more he realizes how important she really is not only does she have the power of chaos magic inside her which would make her a powerful sorceress in her own right but she also has elder blood running through her veins which is a key component needed to produce more witchers this unique combination of magical [ __ ] gives her the ability to tear open the fabric of time and space allowing her to travel to different worlds and allowing creatures to cross over into theirs the upshot here is that siri literally has the power to reshape or even destroy the entire world and because of that she's now got a giant target on her back the nilf guardians the strong female elf leader the diverse female sorceress jennifer vesmir the evil witch and [ __ ] dog the bounty hunter all want her for various reasons to borrow a phrase from nerdrotic she is literally the girl who's the key to everything which conveniently enough brings me along to one of my first criticisms season one very much felt like jennifer's story rather than geralt's which is kind of weird in a show that's literally called the witcher but whatever i rightly assumed that season 2 would focus more on geralt and siri now that they were finally together and well i was half right make no mistake this season is very much siri's story i mean what they actually do with her isn't terrible and it's nice to see the character given some room to breathe and grow instead of being a walking macguffin that everyone's fighting over like last season she actually has to struggle and fail to learn new skills she has to train hard and earn respect and she even has some reverence for her elders instead of coming across like a smug insufferable [ __ ] who already knows everything freya allen seems to have aged about five years between seasons which is no bad thing because siri needed to have more presence and self-confidence now and think [ __ ] the makeup department finally saw fit to give her eyebrows now to be fair girl is still around and it's nice to see him do some actual monster hunting again but for the most part he's not really central to the narrative he's more of a framing device used to get important information across to the audience and support other characters with whatever they need to do we're still given almost no insight into his personal history his perspective on things or even his overall goals and motivations he just really wants to protect siri because uh reasons and it's a shame really because henry cavill is without doubt the best thing in this [ __ ] show he's cool he's physically imposing he's great in the fight scenes and he's got real charisma and screen presence which makes it weird and frustrating that the writers seem determined to have him place second fiddle to siri and yennefer speaking of yennefer the script gives her an excessive amount of scream time for what she actually accomplishes this season a lot of what she does in the first half amounts to pointless busy work designed to eat up screen time and keep her in a holding pattern until it's time to reunite with geralt and siri i mean i like the idea of her struggling to survive in a hostile world without the magic power she's come to rely on but i feel like the show never really commits to this it would have been interesting to see her really go through the mill broken down and humiliated like when we first met her but for the most part she is able to bluff and [ __ ] her way through pretty much any situation she's always got another trick up her sleeve another scathing put down another little ploy to keep her opponents off balance i guess my point here is that it might have been good to see her fall just a little further to make her rise seem all the more impactful but whatever the scriptwriters definitely seem to like her and i know this because the first three episodes basically consist of every single character in the show endlessly harping on about how super awesome and brave and epic she was and how the world is going to be a cold and lonely place without her you know there really is such a thing as show don't tell just saying the other downside to her little escaping evasion subplot is that it brings her back into contact with yaskir who is without [ __ ] question the worst thing in this entire show hugging we are hugging [ __ ] he's still an insufferable ridiculous prick who almost gets his friends killed on multiple occasions through sheer [ __ ] stupidity his actor still plays him like he flinched in off the street and decided to roll with it and he doesn't just chew up the scenery he takes off and nukes the entire site from orbits it's the only way to be sure also i can't shake the feeling that he acts like some kind of proxy for the writers like when a character makes a meta reference to how convoluted and confusing the first season was and yaskir spends the next five minutes berating him for being too bone-headed to understand its genius yeah we see what you're doing there and it's not particularly funny you made your show too [ __ ] complicated and nobody understood what the [ __ ] was happening deal with it on the technical side of things there is a slight improvement over season one the cgi is better and more convincing there's decent establishing shots to give you a better sense of where you are and the cinematography is generally pretty solid i just wish the colour palette was as diverse as the casting though i just can't decide which area was my favorite the grey castle the brown castle the grey village the grey mountain top the brownish grey forest or the other grey castle game of thrones whatever its faults was smart enough to give each location a distinct look and feel so that you always knew where the action was happening one look at the lighting the architecture and the costumes was usually enough to tell you whether you were in winterfell king's landing the iron islands dorn or essos this was pretty important because it helped to build a picture of a complex living believable world with well-defined cultures and nations but the witcher is mostly just a generic mass of people and places all haphazardly thrown in together with no sense of structure or geography and the show's insistence on having people from wildly different ethnicities all mixed in together it doesn't exactly help the audience develop a strong sense of location the end result of all this is a show that's slowly pulling itself out of the mire and finding its own voice it's definitely improving the characters are growing on me and the world of the witcher feels a little bigger and more fleshed out than it did before the problem is that i'm not sure it's really happening fast enough to get people on board and build the momentum it needs to break through into mainstream success what this show really needed was an epic triumphant second season that hit the ground running and didn't let up until the explosive finale instead it kind of stumbled out of the gate cautious and uncertain taking its time to build momentum and only really hitting its stride in the last couple of episodes i really hope it's enough to keep things going because i think there's a great show buried underneath all the flaws and problems netflix just needs to find a way to get to it anyway that's all i've got for today go away now ,0.09644383058697577,0.5198162355117999,0.098,0.753,0.149,0.9989
