we're going to dive straight into our,4.48,3.12
main story tonight which concerns the,5.96,3.32
elections happening around the country,7.6,4.32
in two days there is the usual barrage,9.28,4.479
of negative campaign ads happening right,11.92,3.679
now perhaps none more memorable than,13.759,4.52
this one in a Pennsylvania da race,15.599,4.52
you've seen those motivational signs,18.279,4.0
people have in their offices Matt,20.119,4.601
Dugan's office had a sign too as,22.279,5.84
reported by a KDKA announcer it,24.72,6.92
reads the police,28.119,7.401
wow that is a striking ad now Dugan has,31.64,5.52
pushed back on that saying that's not,35.52,3.32
actually his office it belonged to a,37.16,4.04
different attorney but if so I now want,38.84,4.879
to know everything about them instead,41.2,3.96
because they have to be the only person,43.719,3.281
in the world who has a the police,45.16,3.719
sign next to a Bubblehead of what,47.0,4.719
appears to be James Madison not just,48.879,5.2
that that is next to a statue of Audrey,51.719,4.36
2 from Little Shop of Horrors which in,54.079,4.28
turn is next to a Bubblehead of Teddy,56.079,5.241
Roosevelt those are not usually shared,58.359,5.52
interests that fascinating individual,61.32,3.799
contains,63.879,3.481
multitudes but while some local races,65.119,4.481
are understandably focused on live laugh,67.36,4.88
 the police office signage many,69.6,4.32
others will be focused on Reproductive,72.24,4.199
Rights abortion is a huge issue in the,73.92,4.76
Kentucky Governor's race and the race to,76.439,4.241
control Virginia State Senate and in,78.68,3.96
Ohio there's an amendment on the ballot,80.68,4.36
to enshrine the right to abortion in the,82.64,5.2
state constitution so tonight let's talk,85.04,5.68
about abortion as you know 16 months ago,87.84,4.36
the Supreme Court's dobs decision,90.72,3.96
overturned Ro v Wade and since then it,92.2,4.32
may have been tempting especially if you,94.68,3.64
live in a state unimpacted by the dobs,96.52,4.12
ruling to avoid watching The Fallout,98.32,4.2
from it too closely knowing how,100.64,3.36
depressing it would be and I'll be,102.52,4.04
honest things are Bleak but it's,104.0,4.52
important to understand exactly how,106.56,4.919
Bleak currently 14 states have enacted,108.52,5.68
near total abortion banss and two have,111.479,5.081
imposed six week limits and those banss,114.2,4.08
have prompted many to desperately try to,116.56,3.96
maintain abortion access for those who,118.28,4.32
need it and sometimes in truly,120.52,4.879
imaginative ways a California doctor is,122.6,5.799
proposing a floating abortion clinic as,125.399,5.241
a way to bypass laws in some states that,128.399,4.56
are restricting the procedure she says,130.64,4.0
the clinic would operate on a boat,132.959,3.601
floating in federal waterers just off,134.64,4.44
the Gulf of Mexico so technically making,136.56,5.64
it Out Of Reach to any state laws here,139.08,6.519
wow Lawless territory no rules anything,142.2,5.88
goes it's not only a foolproof plan it's,145.599,4.401
also the literal premise for the movie,148.08,4.6
money plane no you didn't hallucinate,150.0,4.64
that during Peak coid there really was a,152.68,3.96
film about a casino in the sky full of,154.64,3.599
Thieves cartels and arms dealers who can,156.64,3.0
never be arrested because the money,158.239,3.0
plane is always moving in international,159.64,3.879
airspace if you haven't seen it you,161.239,4.041
should frankly stop watching this show,163.519,4.401
right now and go watch that instead if,165.28,5.28
you pop an edible immediately it should,167.92,4.48
start to kick in right around when you,170.56,4.039
meet the film's villain Darius Emanuel,172.4,5.68
Grouch III AKA The Rumble played by,174.599,5.56
Kelsey gramar and he explains the money,178.08,4.36
plane like this whatever you want to,180.159,4.401
wager on the money plane has you covered,182.44,3.879
you want to bet on a dude an,184.56,7.56
alligator money plane yes yes,186.319,8.241
that movie is real it is the Frasier,192.12,4.119
reboot that we,194.56,4.88
deserved anyway back to abortion the,196.239,5.481
dobs decision caused immediate confusion,199.44,4.28
and panic especially in States that had,201.72,3.879
trigger laws already on the books which,203.72,4.04
kicked in almost immediately causing,205.599,4.28
chaos for both patients and abortion,207.76,4.08
provid us as soon as we heard the,209.879,4.841
decision we closed everything down,211.84,6.72
leaving over 70 women in Wisconsin with,214.72,6.84
appointments that we weren't able to do,218.56,5.36
for them I remember asking when is the,221.56,3.959
law going to change how much time do we,223.92,3.519
have to get ready for it and I started,225.519,3.321
to text back and say the law has,227.439,3.121
actually changed right now you know we,228.84,3.959
called patients it's like I'm already on,230.56,3.2
my,232.799,3.921
way and they thought well I'm already on,233.76,5.44
my way it'll be okay and it's like no,236.72,5.32
it's immediate it's immediate look,239.2,4.28
someone canceling plans when you're,242.04,3.24
already on your way is annoying in any,243.48,3.64
circumstance but it is different when,245.28,4.519
that plan is an abortion if dinner plans,247.12,4.28
fall through that is a bummer but at,249.799,3.36
least it won't end with something alien,251.4,3.96
out of your body unless that is you,253.159,4.401
reschedule that dinner to Long John,255.36,6.08
Silvers now thankfully abortion remains,257.56,5.6
legal in many states so at least,261.44,3.92
theoretically someone needing one can,263.16,4.12
travel to one of those States instead,265.36,3.76
but as this doctor points out in,267.28,3.88
practice that can be incredibly,269.12,4.799
difficult we have such inequality that,271.16,5.56
for some it's as easy as okay let's take,273.919,4.681
a weekend trip to Colorado to get your,276.72,3.479
abortion and for someone else it's a,278.6,3.84
completely life-altering thing that you,280.199,3.84
have no control over and you're forced,282.44,3.92
to give birth the trajectory of those,284.039,4.521
two people's lives are completely,286.36,4.76
different it's true for many traveling,288.56,4.919
across state lines isn't feasible even,291.12,4.4
before you consider that in states where,293.479,4.0
abortion remains legal it is not like,295.52,4.04
they've had a sudden surge in providers,297.479,4.16
to handle outof State patients so there,299.56,4.16
are now significant backlogs meaning,301.639,4.201
that women who travel to another state,303.72,3.64
may have more difficulty getting,305.84,4.199
appointments and it may even become hard,307.36,5.16
for those living in some states where it,310.039,4.841
remains legal which clearly isn't great,312.52,3.84
abortion isn't one of those things that,314.88,3.2
you can keep putting off indefinitely,316.36,4.24
like taking up Pottery or figuring out,318.08,4.44
who these guys are and why they're like,320.6,3.719
that I say this with zero malice by the,322.52,3.16
way they seem very wholesome I just,324.319,2.921
don't really understand what their whole,325.68,3.359
deal is I am going to get around to it,327.24,2.76
but to be honest,329.039,2.321
it's not a,330.0,3.8
priority and some are resorting to,331.36,4.399
drastic measures listen to this woman,333.8,3.44
who did manage to get a cross state,335.759,3.681
lines to New Mexico for an abortion,337.24,4.36
describe what's happened to her friends,339.44,4.36
who weren't able to what would you have,341.6,4.039
done if you couldn't come to New Mexico,343.8,5.8
for an abortion God who knows cuz I was,345.639,8.0
already asking people like hey what,349.6,7.96
could I do I've known some women to just,353.639,6.761
kind of take it into their own hands and,357.56,4.919
do like their own abortion like I had a,360.4,4.6
friend tell me she drank a cap of bleach,362.479,5.321
you know I had another woman tell me,365.0,4.639
girl like just take a whole bunch of,367.8,5.239
vitamin C listen there are a lot of very,369.639,5.441
good secret tips that women rightly,373.039,3.6
share with each other like bananas are,375.08,3.88
good for cramps or lipstick works as,376.639,4.881
blush in a pinch or block coach Brett,378.96,5.0
from your Instagram stories but drink,381.52,4.88
bleach or vitamin C to end a pregnancy,383.96,4.6
isn't one of them and unfortunately,386.4,3.639
dangerous measures like like those may,388.56,3.88
now become more common as anti-abortion,390.039,4.56
activists have no intention of stopping,392.44,4.08
their push for restrictions for example,394.599,3.641
they're also going after medication,396.52,3.84
abortions which are estimated to make up,398.24,4.6
half of all abortions a lawsuit to,400.36,3.88
revoke the fda's approval of myth of,402.84,3.6
prisone one of two key drugs in,404.24,3.92
medication abortions is currently,406.44,3.24
working its way through the courts and,408.16,3.64
if that were to succeed it wouldn't just,409.68,4.16
impact states with abortion bans it,411.8,3.92
would affect access across the entire,413.84,4.0
country so abortion La in America is,415.72,4.4
currently a complete cluster with,417.84,4.52
many confused and others considering,420.12,5.12
drinking bleach and yet the people who,422.36,5.16
wrote and passed these laws like this,425.24,3.84
Texas State Legislature will insist that,427.52,4.56
it's all worth it based on who precisely,429.08,5.88
and exclusively they protect thousands,432.08,4.399
and thousands and thousands of people,434.96,3.239
who would have chosen to have an,436.479,3.801
abortion now don't have that choice,438.199,3.4
that's right what do you say to those,440.28,3.44
people those are thousands and thousands,441.599,4.841
of little babies that are now alive we,443.72,5.36
are a very safe place for little babies,446.44,4.8
what a about women we are a very safe,449.08,5.04
space for little for women as well,451.24,5.32
oopsie you nearly said the quiet part,454.12,4.799
out loud there didn't you also it is a,456.56,4.28
pretty sad State of Affairs when but,458.919,4.321
what about women genuinely counts as a,460.84,4.84
gotcha question because For the record,463.24,5.04
abortion bands are objectively not safe,465.68,4.44
for women and can needlessly put them,468.28,4.039
through absolute hell take what happened,470.12,4.359
to this woman in Texas whose ultrasound,472.319,3.88
not only revealed no chance of survival,474.479,3.801
for the fetus but also potentially,476.199,3.68
life-threatening complic,478.28,5.479
for her Kay's doctor was clear when he's,479.879,6.201
born he's going to suffocate to death he,483.759,3.84
may live for a few minutes he may live,486.08,3.92
for an hour but he is going to die her,487.599,4.241
doctors said they could not perform an,490.0,3.8
abortion noting in her records,491.84,4.28
termination is not legal in the state of,493.8,5.079
Texas how could you be so cruel as to,496.12,7.24
pass a law that you know will hurt women,498.879,7.16
and that you know will cause babies to,503.36,5.2
be born in pain he was going to die a,506.039,4.361
painful death,508.56,4.24
so how is that Humane how is that saving,510.4,4.24
anybody they desperately want to have,512.8,3.44
another baby but there's a high,514.64,3.399
likelihood that something will go wrong,516.24,4.799
again the last time that I saw my OB she,518.039,5.681
said do not get pregnant in Texas right,521.039,6.201
now wow that is not only devastating it,523.72,5.72
is a truly horrible thing to have to add,527.24,3.44
to the list of things that pregnant,529.44,3.079
women are not safe to do so it's now,530.68,4.12
officially ride a roller coaster eat,532.519,5.121
sushi dye your roots and simply exist in,534.8,5.599
the state of Texas medical professionals,537.64,3.96
are now finding themselves caught in the,540.399,2.721
middle between trying to do what they,541.6,3.04
know is medically right for their,543.12,3.64
patients while also not running a foul,544.64,3.8
of the law or having their license,546.76,3.319
revoked one doctor said that her,548.44,3.68
colleagues were so unsure of whether or,550.079,3.681
not they could legally recommend their,552.12,3.719
patients seek abortions elsewhere that,553.76,3.759
they resorted to saying things like the,555.839,3.601
weather's really nice in New Mexico,557.519,4.201
right now you should check it out or,559.44,4.16
I've heard traveling to Colorado is,561.72,3.72
really nice this time of year which,563.6,4.04
isn't just absurd I'm not even sure,565.44,4.56
those are effective hints,567.64,4.6
New Mexico and Colorado are two of the,570.0,4.2
most objectively beautiful states in the,572.24,4.08
nation that could just be a nice,574.2,4.28
vacation tip now if the doctor were,576.32,4.56
recommending visiting Newark New Jersey,578.48,4.84
or saying I've heard Buffalo's nice this,580.88,4.32
time of year then sure you know,583.32,4.0
something else was clearly being,585.2,3.92
communicated and while you might think,587.32,3.88
that doctors facing emergency situations,589.12,3.959
should simply take it upon themselves to,591.2,4.56
quietly perform abortions anyway as this,593.079,5.401
OBGYN points out it's just not that,595.76,4.96
simple some people say well doctors,598.48,3.799
should just do it you should just go,600.72,3.4
take that patient to the O and do that,602.279,3.881
abortion I don't know of any doctor who,604.12,3.76
does an abortion just by themselves it,606.16,3.919
requires an anesthesia team a nursing,607.88,4.36
team supervising team to get you into,610.079,4.601
the O so in order for somebody to to,612.24,3.88
agree with me is I want to take that,614.68,3.12
patient to the O there's lots of other,616.12,3.6
people who are going to weigh into and,617.8,3.68
be scared and say no no we have to wait,619.72,4.239
for legal to sign off and that's when,621.48,6.56
people die holy we have to wait for,623.959,5.681
legal to sign off,628.04,3.52
is not something you want to hear before,629.64,3.48
receiving urgent medical care that is,631.56,3.24
something that we say when we want to,633.12,3.959
show this photo while saying the,634.8,5.36
sentenced sex crimes are bad or,637.079,5.081
playfully accuse a c Baron of being the,640.16,3.799
Zodiac Killer I shouldn't joke about,642.16,3.4
that though I'm sure Bob marray is,643.959,3.161
probably a lot more sympathetic to black,645.56,3.32
lung victims now that he is burning in,647.12,4.8
hell but but the larger Point remains,648.88,4.88
that even if you do have one doctor,651.92,3.44
willing to break the law and assume the,653.76,3.48
risks you still might not have a whole,655.36,4.919
team abortions are like improv everyone,657.24,5.56
involved has to be fully on board and if,660.279,4.8
just one person doesn't commit it's over,662.8,4.039
also even when it goes well you're like,665.079,3.56
okay that was fine can I go home now,666.839,4.361
please don't make me come back next week,668.639,4.841
and the crushing thing is that doctor,671.2,4.52
isn't even being overly cautious there,673.48,3.919
because while these laws do have,675.72,3.359
exceptions in instances where the life,677.399,3.641
of the mother is in danger there's a,679.079,3.76
huge difference between life of the,681.04,4.68
mother and health of the mother all of,682.839,4.881
these states have near total abortion,685.72,4.44
bans that do not make exceptions,687.72,4.84
considering the health of the mother but,690.16,3.919
even in states that do have those,692.56,3.04
exceptions they're often written so,694.079,3.601
vaguely or narrowly that doctors can be,695.6,4.44
unsure how to apply them take Texas,697.68,4.52
again where the health exceptions only,700.04,4.64
apply for a few highly specific,702.2,4.759
conditions so for everyone else doctors,704.68,4.24
now waiting until a patient is at actual,706.959,4.601
risk of imminent death to intervene,708.92,4.28
listen to this woman describe what she,711.56,3.56
went through after a fatal fetal,713.2,3.56
condition was diagnosed during her,715.12,4.12
pregnancy I had to wait until one of,716.76,4.16
three things happened either her heart,719.24,3.8
stopped beating I went into labor,720.92,5.479
naturally or I became so sick that my,723.04,6.16
life was in danger and at that point,726.399,4.56
because of the laws the doctors would be,729.2,4.439
able to induce me um and and we could,730.959,4.801
begin the delivery process I was first,733.639,5.88
diagnosed on Tuesday and it took until,735.76,6.639
Friday for one of those three things to,739.519,5.241
occur and for me what happened was I got,742.399,4.481
really really sick really really fast,744.76,5.12
obviously we live in the middle of Texas,746.88,6.16
which is a giant state so to get out of,749.88,5.28
Texas and to get to a neighboring state,753.04,4.039
where we could have gotten Healthcare we,755.16,4.44
would have either had to drive at least,757.079,6.2
8 hours or fly somewhere okay just so we,759.6,5.64
are all perfectly clear when we say that,763.279,3.68
these laws take away people's right to,765.24,3.719
control their own body this is what,766.959,3.961
we're talking about she had to wait from,768.959,4.161
Tuesday to Friday to get close enough to,770.92,4.8
dying to be saved preemptively choosing,773.12,4.92
to save her own life was illegal in her,775.72,4.88
State a state remember this man says is,778.04,5.76
safe for little sorry for women and when,780.6,4.679
you take all of this into account it is,783.8,2.96
no wonder that women in states with,785.279,3.36
abortion banss are nearly three times,786.76,3.72
more likely to die during pregnancy,788.639,3.921
child birth or soon after and this is,790.48,4.12
only exacerbated for people of color who,792.56,4.2
already faced significant disparities in,794.6,4.28
maternal and infant Health before the,796.76,4.36
dobs decision and at this point let's,798.88,4.319
talk about who is making these laws,801.12,3.92
because the rhetoric around the do's,803.199,3.481
decision was that it simply return,805.04,3.919
decisions on abortion to the state which,806.68,4.92
is a very nice way of saying it removed,808.959,4.68
decisions from individuals and their,811.6,4.52
doctors and placed them in the hands of,813.639,4.841
state legislators and those politicians,816.12,4.2
are now legislating medicine without,818.48,4.28
even a modicum of medical understanding,820.32,4.56
which is understandably incredibly,822.76,5.0
frustrating for people like this OBGYN,824.88,5.24
there's the feeling that your,827.76,4.36
expertise no one,830.12,5.8
cares no one cares went to school for 12,832.12,6.48
years of my life done this for 33 years,835.92,5.599
but but that guy from down south in,838.6,5.159
Oklahoma who's never picked up a medical,841.519,4.481
textbook in his life he knows all about,843.759,5.64
it I mean there's you definitely feel no,846.0,5.04
one cares what you think is an expert no,849.399,3.841
one cares right and honestly I would,851.04,4.2
give literally anything for legislators,853.24,3.519
in Oklahoma to have to explain their,855.24,3.719
reasoning to this Doctor Who Laughs like,856.759,4.281
a woman who has spent 45 years of her,858.959,4.56
life smiling on the outside and saying,861.04,5.039
go yourself on the inside which I,863.519,4.081
do realize sounds like the title of a,866.079,4.56
guides to being a woman in America and,867.6,5.28
it is not just that those pushing these,870.639,4.12
laws are non-experts they're also,872.88,3.36
overwhelmingly being pushed by people,874.759,3.64
who can't get pregnant either when it,876.24,3.76
comes to those so-called trigger laws,878.399,3.8
that banned abortion so quickly after,880.0,5.16
dobs 84% of the lawmakers who sponsored,882.199,5.88
them were men and look clearly they are,885.16,4.84
the the key problem here but let's also,888.079,5.12
take a second for the 16% of lawmakers,890.0,5.04
who were women because if you're a woman,893.199,4.0
voting against abortion access you are,895.04,3.52
and I'm told that this is the meanest,897.199,2.481
thing think that this voice is allowed,898.56,4.32
to say not a girl's,899.68,7.12
girl and some of those male legislators,902.88,6.28
truly did not know what they were doing,906.8,3.959
and that's by their own admission this,909.16,3.96
Idaho Republican voted for an extremely,910.759,4.121
restrictive abortion ban and has since,913.12,4.0
had second thoughts about how broad it,914.88,4.48
actually is but listen to him explain,917.12,4.2
just how little thought he put into his,919.36,4.44
original decision it really wasn't up,921.32,4.319
high on my radar other,923.8,5.64
than be I'm a pro-life guy and and I ran,925.639,6.481
that way um but I didn't see it as a had,929.44,4.68
a real having a real big Community,932.12,4.159
impact then he started talking with,934.12,4.32
local doctors what I'm wondering is for,936.279,3.92
you personally did you think about,938.44,4.759
abortion as it relates to obstetric care,940.199,6.601
for pregnant women no I I don't I don't,943.199,4.481
think,946.8,4.32
I I you know it's like anything you you,947.68,5.04
get exposed to something all of a sudden,951.12,3.199
you go wow there there's a different way,952.72,4.599
to look at this,954.319,6.241
H look part of me wants to welcome that,957.319,5.281
man's ability to recognize his own blind,960.56,3.759
spots there but are you really saying,962.6,3.159
that you didn't think about how your,964.319,3.361
vote would affect literally half of your,965.759,4.801
constituents you're a legislator,967.68,5.279
that's not a cute little oopsie it's not,970.56,4.12
like joking that Timothy shalamay could,972.959,3.041
play a Young Willie Wonker and the,974.68,3.159
studio immediately greenlit it and now,976.0,3.16
you have to figure out what the,977.839,2.24
that,979.16,4.919
means that is a dereliction of Duty so,980.079,6.161
what do we do now well first do feel,984.079,4.521
free to scream into a pillow uh when,986.24,4.44
you're on the bus on the kiss cam at a,988.6,3.679
basketball game there is no,990.68,3.599
inappropriate time to be screaming about,992.279,4.8
this but also know that we can still act,994.279,5.521
here some have taken some small steps in,997.079,4.601
the last year that are if nothing else,999.8,4.08
immensely satisfying like this one that,1001.68,4.76
was covered by a Catholic News Network,1003.88,4.92
an international group named after Satan,1006.44,4.759
will soon open its first abortion,1008.8,4.599
business in the United States the,1011.199,4.481
satanic temple which claims to not,1013.399,5.24
believe in a literal Satan will provide,1015.68,5.2
Health screenings and prescribe abortion,1018.639,4.841
pills for patients in New Mexico the,1020.88,4.84
name of the soon to be facility the,1023.48,6.079
Samuel Al's mom's satanic,1025.72,5.8
abortion,1029.559,5.801
incredible very well played now is that,1031.52,5.279
going to fix everything no of course it,1035.36,2.88
isn't but when it comes to responding to,1036.799,3.961
such widespread Devastation you could do,1038.24,4.4
a lot worse than the single best Your,1040.76,4.96
mom joke of all time especially when you,1042.64,4.159
add in that one of the group's,1045.72,4.0
co-founders even said in 1950 Samuel,1046.799,5.561
alito's mother did not have options and,1049.72,5.76
look what happened but the most,1052.36,5.04
important thing for you to do right now,1055.48,3.96
is and I apologize in advance for even,1057.4,5.399
saying this to vote abortion rights are,1059.44,6.04
for all the attacks on them still widely,1062.799,5.041
popular Six States have had abortion,1065.48,3.88
related measures on the ballot since,1067.84,4.76
dobs and in all six voters preserved,1069.36,5.0
access to abortion and that was even,1072.6,4.6
true in red States like Montana Kansas,1074.36,5.0
and Kentucky the this is genuinely a,1077.2,4.2
case where voting can have an immediate,1079.36,4.799
and Lasting effect and to that end as I,1081.4,4.36
mentioned there are some important,1084.159,3.041
elections on Tuesday where it's going to,1085.76,3.64
be crucial to continue that streak if,1087.2,4.359
you live in Virginia Democrats lost the,1089.4,4.68
house and Governor's seat in 2021 but,1091.559,4.761
still control the state senate and only,1094.08,4.079
because of that were they able earlier,1096.32,3.76
this year to stop three bills that would,1098.159,3.681
have restricted abortion but if they,1100.08,3.52
lose the Senate next week that will,1101.84,3.839
clearly change meanwhile in Kentucky the,1103.6,4.12
incumbent Governor Andy Basher is being,1105.679,4.12
challenged by conservative AG Daniel,1107.72,3.72
Cameron who you might remember from his,1109.799,3.281
disastrous handling of the Banna Taylor,1111.44,3.96
case he has also said in a questionnaire,1113.08,4.2
circulated by an anti-abortion group,1115.4,3.84
that he support codifying personhood,1117.28,4.44
from the moment of fertilization and,1119.24,4.439
criminalizing providers who perform,1121.72,3.76
abortions while all of that is obviously,1123.679,4.201
terrible how exactly does he intend to,1125.48,4.84
enforce life beginning at,1127.88,4.679
fertilization does everyone now have to,1130.32,4.88
 in front of him no thank you very,1132.559,5.0
much Daniel the only Kian who should,1135.2,4.24
enjoy that privilege is the colonel and,1137.559,4.0
no not that one I'm talking about the,1139.44,6.2
Reber colel There You Go sir Madam NB,1141.559,5.48
icon it would be an honor and a,1145.64,4.32
privilege to fornicate in your presence,1147.039,4.921
and finally if you live in Ohio a ballot,1149.96,3.719
measure on Tuesday would enshrine a,1151.96,3.36
right to abortion in your State's,1153.679,3.24
Constitution it is a measure that is,1155.32,2.76
currently being targeted by its,1156.919,3.601
opponents in some wildly misleading,1158.08,4.92
campaign ads the abortion industry's,1160.52,4.72
proposed amendment would allow No Limit,1163.0,4.24
abortions in,1165.24,4.559
Ohio,1167.24,5.08
abortions when the baby can feel pain,1169.799,4.801
excruciating,1172.32,5.32
pain on top of that the same radical,1174.6,4.8
groups want to tear at the fabric that,1177.64,4.039
holds our families,1179.4,4.519
together allow our children to get,1181.679,5.24
abortions without our consent and remove,1183.919,5.681
all protections for The Unborn as,1186.919,6.281
parents it's our worst nightmare wow,1189.6,5.76
that ads argument is basically abortion,1193.2,3.68
rights are an assault on the traditional,1195.36,3.72
American Family a father a mother and,1196.88,5.96
another mother who's 12 also if as a,1199.08,6.2
parent your worst nightmare is your,1202.84,4.04
child getting pregnant and not having to,1205.28,3.72
stay that way if they don't want to I,1206.88,3.4
don't know I guess we just have,1209.0,3.24
different nightmares because there's an,1210.28,3.68
objectively correct hierarchy of,1212.24,3.679
Parental fears and it's one losing one,1213.96,3.839
of your children two something terrible,1215.919,3.521
happened to one of your children three,1217.799,3.24
losing one of them but not in a dead way,1219.44,3.84
in the oh I can't find them way and,1221.039,3.441
then you have to decide whether to look,1223.28,2.84
for them on your own or let someone know,1224.48,2.84
immediately that they're missing because,1226.12,2.439
if something's really wrong you are,1227.32,2.56
going to need help but if they're just,1228.559,3.961
kind of around looking for Lego sets you,1229.88,3.88
don't want to announce to the target,1232.52,2.8
employees that you're a negligent parent,1233.76,3.799
who misplaced your child number four,1235.32,4.239
your children hating you for exactly the,1237.559,3.801
person you are that's not because of any,1239.559,3.041
misunderstanding or anything your kids,1241.36,2.88
know exactly what you're about and they,1242.6,4.12
justifiably want nothing to do with you,1244.24,4.36
and finally number five your child gets,1246.72,3.12
really good at,1248.6,3.199
swimming because that means you have to,1249.84,4.28
take them to the pool by 500 a.m. every,1251.799,5.76
other morning for 10 years a,1254.12,5.48
child exercising bodily autonomy is,1257.559,4.201
nowhere near a worst nightmare scenario,1259.6,5.36
except for maybe the swimming thing look,1261.76,4.919
this past year and a half has clearly,1264.96,3.44
been devastating when it comes to,1266.679,3.6
abortion rights and to be clear I'm not,1268.4,3.879
just talking about the quote unintended,1270.279,4.441
consequences around wanted pregnancies,1272.279,4.441
I'm talking about the intended ones for,1274.72,4.199
unwanted pregnancies too and abortion is,1276.72,4.48
a medical decision between a patient and,1278.919,4.561
their doctor full stop and it is,1281.2,4.359
maddening to see some push to make their,1283.48,4.64
states safe for little babies will also,1285.559,4.201
making it far more dangerous for the,1288.12,4.36
people they grow up to be but the Hope,1289.76,5.36
here and there actually is some hope is,1292.48,4.76
that as much as the needs lives and,1295.12,4.159
choices of women have been dismissed is,1297.24,4.76
also how much their anger and tenacity,1299.279,4.961
has been underestimated you've seen,1302.0,4.0
doctors and medical professionals,1304.24,3.84
offering theirselves and services and,1306.0,4.08
you've seen people like these bravely,1308.08,4.479
and selflessly reliving private often,1310.08,4.24
difficult moments to educate and,1312.559,4.48
Galvanize others so many people have,1314.32,4.359
been working tireless ly to make this,1317.039,3.681
better and I wish they didn't have to I,1318.679,3.281
wish they could devote their lives and,1320.72,3.04
talents to something besides publicly,1321.96,4.28
fighting for basic necessary health care,1323.76,4.519
but they can't because this is an,1326.24,4.28
emergency and one that requires action,1328.279,5.28
from all of us and hopefully one day we,1330.52,4.96
can eventually get to a place where,1333.559,4.24
people who want to end a pregnancy save,1335.48,4.88
their own life or make any other medical,1337.799,4.48
or reproductive decision about their own,1340.36,4.439
body will not have to seek out the same,1342.279,4.681
legal loopholes that the money plane,1344.799,4.24
provides for those who want to bet on a,1346.96,6.68
dude an alligator in front of,1349.039,4.601
Frasier,1363.96,3.0
