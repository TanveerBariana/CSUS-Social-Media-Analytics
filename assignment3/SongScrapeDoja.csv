Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Yeah, yeah
Said, my happiness is all of your misery
I put good dick all in my kidneys
This Margiel' don't come with no jealousy
My illness don't come with no remedy
I am so much fun without Hennessy
They just want my love and my energy
You can't talk no shit without penalties
Bitch, I'm in your shit if you send for me
I'm goin' to glow up one more time
Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon' see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times
Ugh, you can't take that bitch nowhere
Ugh, I look better with no hair
Ugh, ain't no sign, I can smoke here
Ugh, give me the chance and I'll go there (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Yeah, yeah
Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot, like you tryna have a food fight, then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said, I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb but extremists are
I'm a demon, Lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more

'Cause, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by"
1,Kiss Me More (feat. SZA),"We hug and yes, we make love
And always just say ""Goodnight"" (La-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

I, I feel like fuckin' something
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy-dummy
I like to say, what if, but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme too
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lipgloss, hickeys too, uh

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on ya [*ding*], you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (Ah)
Drama make you feel (Ah)
Fantasy and whip appeal
Is all I can give you

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh
Oh, darling

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it"
