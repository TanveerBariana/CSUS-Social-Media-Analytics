0,[Music] witcher season two has arrived and what a wonderful treat over the christmas break while i was on vacation while i could get internet on the stupid satellite piece of [ __ ] i was watching witcher season two and uh i will start by saying our sponsor today is you guys thank you very much consider directly uh supporting our channel with a patreon or youtube join button it helps us against demonetization and helps us bring you these extra reviews so thank you so much for supporting the angry joe show over 2021 and into 2022. so um let's say witcher season two um i freaking loved it now when i was reading on several stuff i see some people are like eh well i'm mixed on it yeah or i don't really like it or it changes things from the books and i mean it already kind of changes a little bit of things um and it sort of continues to do that here but i gotta say i freaking loved it uh i think it's even i actually think it's probably it's on par with season one and maybe in many ways better than season one i at least i think so uh certainly individual episodes uh rise to the top there is uh you know some some filler and and some things where it's not running on all cylinders but uh for the most part these eight episodes really uh were awesome for me and they they uh it reminded very very much at times with the witcher 3 game uh very different from the game but we do get some of the siri training stuff now the video game did it way better yes obviously right obviously and uh but you know some of that is here and they also incorporate some of the several short stories from the books uh in into this the only thing that i wish we would have got more and it's kind of too late for it now maybe and they do a little bit of it in this season it's like individual geralt stories you know what i mean without this siri plot because right now we are 100 everything is [ __ ] focused on siri you know what i mean and i just wanted a little bit more geralt centered stuff and you get that actually in an amazing opening episode one of the best of the season in episode one um grain of truth yeah grain of truth and this was actually taken from one of uh the short stories and it almost kind of feels a little separate from the rest of the thing i mean you could kind of take out the overall plot and have this like side thing going on uh and so i i really like this particular one but before we get into the individual episode breakdowns and we'll give you scores for each one um i want to hear your guys's opinion so i really really like season two i think maybe it's better than season one what did you think for me i thought this was great but i still like season one way better uh this one uh for me some of the it's kind of some of these trophy things in the writing is like hey you should have just said this you didn't have to like do stupid [ __ ] a lot of stupid [ __ ] was done i was like that just yeah we'll talk about that but it's like that's just uh kind of out of character yeah and like you said it really focuses on uh siri but you know who my favorite is but kind of took a back seat but overall i thought it was a great one who's your favorite joe just so i can make sure oh yeah i know you might have heard of him henry okay does take a little bit of a backseat he doesn't talk more in this one yeah and more than more than some grunts even though he's got some grunts in there so you like season one better okay interesting what about you alex yeah i definitely like season one better this one i i with the exception of the first episode i don't know why i just kind of constantly got sucked out of this season there was some cringy writing there was they they definitely employed some of the things that i have as pet peeves in writing where it's like two characters one character knows something and one character doesn't and human beings would just talk about stuff you know the most important things in their life and they don't to drive plot because they apparently don't know how to write uh anything uh there's some serious character assassinations ooh serious character assassinations see that's what i like now i'm starting to consider my position because there were episodes here that got so good but they're like so good yeah yeah and i was so on board and then it just starts to dwindle and i don't hate this season i love the witcher world my buddy gave me some of the books i've started reading them i really enjoy you know most of what i what i'm seeing in there and so i'm not as passionate as the people like i've read every single book but it's like look i've played the games i've read some of the books i like some of the stuff going on here they just need to have someone else assist in the writing yes because there's some serious things here that just are unacceptable there's one scene where they're like caremorin is secret and hidden we don't tell anyone where it is uh because you know you lost all the witchers and then the very next scene prostitute party everyone's allowed here don't worry they'll forget about the morning yeah they'll frigging in the morning it's like look there's just some [ __ ] will yeah yeah you can tell these writers aren't on par with some book readers and and even henry cavill no it feels like he respects it more than the right i don't know anything i haven't read the books but this just seemed off because i was like okay nobody's supposed to know he's like hey you know the [ __ ] rules season one was based on the last wish and the sword of destiny uh with uh and but this this season season two is based on a grain of truth from the last wish that was that little uh short story which i thought was the best episode if amongst the best and then this one was blood of elves and then the beginning of time of contempt so unfortunately it does have to rely on a little bit of the books and and frankly there's not a lot of action in some of these books that we're doing over season two and i think what they tried to do is up the monster count and so sometimes it feels like oh well we every episode he's got to fight him monster of the week stuff but you know what i'd rather him do that than not fight any monsters at all because i do like seeing him drink the potions and and and do the mutagens and fight against the monsters and he does a wonderful job in it um so i can see what you're saying yeah the writing is probably the weakest part of season two and i think i almost am certain that as we go into season three it's going to get better um especially you know henry cavill even is is contributing parts uh because we got to talk about it someone has to read the book on that set because no one else did yes this woman sat down with ign and said hey i do not have to invent content like they do with game of thrones i have all of these books i'm going to stick with them and apparently she forgot she said that yeah so um i'm wondering if i should talk about spoiler let's do a separate section for that i will talk because she does make changes that pissed off some fans especially with eskel uh you can even say jennifer he was one uh i still can't get over the casting of uh trish oh look okay yeah joe let's also talk about this i can't do it i'm trying i can't do it i tried and yeah the actress does the best she can and honestly in the book content she doesn't really have much to do in interest but they try to uh you know expand her role here and i just i'm not on board because of the video games i just think things are miscast pretty much there's a lot of miscasting over time i've gotten used to siri i've uh geralt nails it that's a 10 out of 10. but unfortunately jennifer i think has come into her own but i still it's still a little bit within the first time you like a prince nope you don't [ __ ] it up dandelion's awesome i like dandelion attitude uh vesamir i i wish you know i wasn't the rumors of like like people wanted mark hamill and i keep seeing mark hamill there instead of him and i said mark would have done such a better job both did not like vesamir and some of the costumes are a little hokey like desirable that the armor the pauldrons or whatever are two inches too long they're just little little things here and there um but i will say uh the writing is is the problem i had uh the most in this and did anybody notice it started to annoy me how much they say [ __ ] they say [ __ ] a lot in this too much it doesn't really work for me um everyone says it even uh naneki you know uh that that um geralt's sort of confidant uh she's she taught him how to do the signs and magic she's even drawing f-bombs like everybody says [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's too much yeah you know it reminds me of battlestar galactica where they said frack but all the time but even but in that way it just felt appropriate here it feels like they're like they're trying to be cool trying to be game of thrones i just don't think they'd say it that much you know high school it's as if yeah it's as if every single k and every single character does say it and it just feels like only a certain few characters should be should be saying it so that that kind of ruins it um kind of slow paced i don't know if you all got that oh some of the story lines i i just was like almost put to sleep please stop i don't so let's um okay so let's just go ahead and give you i thought it was a good season at moments i'll take it back at moments better than season one but it does uh stumble at a few parts and uh so let's go to final verdicts on overall season one and then we'll do the episode breakdown with the spoilers for those of you who haven't seen season two yet i highly recommend you go out and see it uh henry cavill's performance and and moments that he adds himself there's one particular moment with roach that i'll talk about later um that you could tell he just loves uh the source material and he's doing the best he can the writing at times is a little weak the individual stories about geralt's backstory that's when it's kind of very interesting and then we have uh the propelling of uh siri and if you know siri from the book she's like very very powerful and essentially the most power it's like a weapon right and everybody wants siri by the end and saying it's up to geralt to protect her so that's kind of what season two is about so let's go with final verdicts overall on uh season um overall i'm i'm torn between like an eight or nine it's still great to watch that too high for you i'm sorry i really really did enjoy it but i still like the first one first uh the writing the pacing the cast uh some of it brought it down for me and it just some of these episodes are just like you said fillers i would probably say like a eight high eight okay not not quite nine but eight there was there was no nakedness no uh henry and tubs in this one no nudity at all kidding it means it needs to up the nudity instead of saying okay what would you give it john okay uh go ahead alex uh i think that there was too many of these side story lines that just didn't resonate with me i love shows with political intrigue i actually am familiar with these kingdoms and they're them vying for power just you know mainly from the games and i just wasn't interested at all we're focusing on characters ah there's so much fragilla and and it's just not i just yeah um if you don't give a [ __ ] about the elves in this universe you're going to be bored for a long time yeah i don't think that that storyline resonated with me at all i understand it's for the books i understand it's important i just don't think they did a very good job with it for someone who is not i just i was bored to tears with that storyline it didn't go anywhere we went from and it's a huge huge portion of the show i think that they really did several main characters very dirty um there are people just their characters important characters just completely cast aside there's all sorts of people that are just killed off for no reason uh there there's a lot of things here that i just don't think if i didn't love the game so much and i wasn't enjoying when i'm reading so much i would not watch season three oh like i think that this is barely above average television i loved episode one and it was just a downhill trek from there normally this would be something i would start at night watch half the season and then finish it the next morning over breakfast that's something that we like to do uh and this we broke it up over as many sessions as we could because we really didn't want to watch the next episode i did it for work um so i'm giving you so unfortunately i'm giving this a low six i think this is a lot of witcher 3 beer goggles and like watching this and i just really hope that they actually read the books and stop inventing [ __ ] and changing major characters i heard their justification for some of the things that she did and it's weak horseshit that only a bad writer with no imagination comes up with oh i had to do this because of this situation yeah and then everyone on the internet it's like you're an idiot this is the hundreds of things you could do so it's great joe just took a huge drink there uh i disagree with you alex i think i i really did enjoy this i thought at times this was better than the first season because i i do you say you didn't like the political intrigue or there was missing here not missing but but done poorly and there are moments where it is i i have to admit that especially with some characters but i really like the world and i'm just i'm about which or i've played the games i've read some of the books though nowhere near as much as i should have and and and and i can after this series but i think that this is its own uh you know aspect and so seeing it take some different directions and risks with the characters i'm for certain times and i'm against other times and we can talk about those specific ones as we get into spoilers but i think the political intrigue is there but especially between the brotherhood and these mages and you know uh friendella with the nilfgaardians and and and kahir uh and the emperor is is up in here this kind of reminds me it kind of ends like with the way the video game ends with a revelation about siri but without the cool wild hunt battle i think they're saving that for you know a future book and for uh a future season so um we get a lot of the political intrigue this is basically uh series training series realization of how special she is and how powerful she is and all of the different uh countries factions uh powerful people in the world realizing what's going on with siri and then they're all like and then and then geralt's relationship with siri is really fleshed out here and and explored and he he takes this sort of father figure to and i really like that relationship by that relationship by the end she calls him father and and that stuff is just great for me um and and but see alex is right and some of this stuff takes away from that because we're just spending a lot of time on on some of those things that maybe the writing is not quite as strong to make it feel like all that political intrigue is there but it is there ultimately and while i disagree with some of the character decisions i thought that it was entertaining enough i kept wanting to watch the next episode i was interested i liked how they tried to do more monster battles when they could a little bit more action that were in these particular books there were action but they tried to do a little bit more here and uh yeah i liked it overall so i gave the first uh witcher season one an eight out of ten and this one i think has the potential to go to nine but it does misstep several times so i'm i'm between seven eight nine i think that witcher season two man i could see it a seven but i'm gonna go with i'm gonna i'm gonna do an eight out of ten just like the first season because there are elements the this season that are better uh the action and the monster hunting and the series stuff and then there are elements that are worse uh uh blood elves and some of the other witchers and karamorin and i wish there was uh some some better stuff there and then the final climactic battle could have been a little bit better than what we got unfortunately so anyway season two i highly recommend you still watch it and i think that uh it's going great places because i heard it's one of their best watches uh one of their most popular shows we're definitely getting a season three um the author is still writing books so i i think we're getting at least probably five seasons of the witcher and i'm excited for them and i think maybe this one does a few missteps here and there they can correct it recently they're seeing the feedback i mean laura on twitter is she's even defending certain decisions with eskel so she is engaged with the viewers you remember the ball sack armor they even made a boss joke i was gonna say dandelion is like man i'm like like i'm stink so bad like like a ball snack guardian so she's self-referential humor in there and i think that she can react i think yes she made some few missteps here but i think that uh with with henry's uh you know writing notes and then her writers may be read i hope so looking at it we can get an even better season three because you're right this material has the capability of hitting 10 out of 10 of hitting nine and and it feels like it's almost there we just needed a little bit more so we'll go into individual episode breakdowns uh thank you so much well yeah after like after like did i get my ring it's eight out of ten yeah eight out of ten after like uh these uh episodes with the elves and stuff i'm not really looking forward to this all right did you see the spin-off trailer with michelle yo with the blood out i don't care about the elves i really don't i'm sorry i i'm here for witches i'm here for henry i'm here you know even jennifer and siri that that interest and the wild hunt i'm i'm really here for that so but uh i'm not gonna watch that show and i think netflix is making a mistake they think that this is like they're like no we gotta make as much as you can it's gonna be so popular this is so popular that will be popular i think that show will fail i don't think that show will get multiple seasons they need to be concentrating on budget to make the budget for which are better it was huge they see this make it even bigger production the one thing about this season is production value was excellent yes and that's probably what what's what's giving me this feeling like it's better in parts okay so let's go to individual breakdowns thank you so much for watching uh subscribe to us here on youtube uh if you want to go above and beyond grab our patreon down there and it'll help us out sweet merch as well so let's do the episode breakdown so episode one is the grain of truth uh this [ __ ] nine out of ten if not ten out of ten uh i think it's ten out of ten uh geralt uh go ahead is one of y'all take it uh they you know they're wandering through the snow they don't know what's his name yeah yeah that sounds right uh they're wandering through the snow there's an almost uh abandoned village and his you know witcher you know sense is going off like crazy like this isn't right so they they leave they're like we're not hanging around here and it opens really good because you have no idea what's going on so village just come in and [ __ ] get murdered yeah holy [ __ ] that's like all right that's a great start and then they they go to uh beauty and the beast that's what it is essentially it is he has been cursed he's been turned into a like a warthog beast and he's like i do look different since you last seen me and it's yeah you have uh what i didn't understand i was like that's not a curse he could [ __ ] conjure whatever the [ __ ] he wants did you notice that he's got food he's got [ __ ] things i'm like damn that's a pretty sweet curse so i don't know they kind of [ __ ] that up yeah and but that's that's book material anyways there's there's something in the background that you know siri and and not not so much geralt but siri's noticing and interacting with uh what she thinks is a cat or a pet or something like that and it turns out that it is this [ __ ] vampire lady thing that feeds on nibbling every night and is a part of his curse uh not just him murdered everyone in that little village and all of the yeah so it's kind of getting out of control yeah and uh he did some bad things and it's revealed by the end uh you know and he tries to avoid it as best as he can because i'm like this guy's hiding something he's like what's going on here and he won't elaborate on what the curse is about how to break the curse all this other stuff turns out he [ __ ] ransacked a um a temple and raped a priestess and so he's like a [ __ ] rapist you know and at the end of this one and i think the book is a little more morally gray this one they just like straight up leave them they're like later he's like no you know kill me or you know like this [ __ ] sucks because he even he's by the end he still makes the right decision because uh you know the the vampire lady she has urges and she feeds on him and she literally killed an entire town so while it's a sad story for her because it seems like you know she's trying to form a friendship with siri now whether it's to gain her trust or whether she's truly scared of geralt it's actually all of it you know um because gerald is a monster hunter um but it turns out she does she does attack and and it's nibbling himself that uh manages to uh deliver the the killing blow and you know he's in tears and it just his life is [ __ ] ruined and his curse dissipates and um and geraldine yeah uh siri is just like all right you know later later bye no he's like no he's like no we don't need somebody like this with us a rapist no um very interesting story [ __ ] cool take cool twist on beauty and the beast [Music] no um and also during this time we forgot to mention uh jennifer's storyline so geralt thinks jennifer is dead after the the the season one uh climax and she lost her magic and she's lost her magic she's taken by friendzilla as prisoner by the nilf guardians even though she's like [ __ ] um murdered their entire army with her badass powers um and she at the end of the episode they're going through the force and she is [ __ ] ambushed like big [ __ ] pillars come out of nowhere or uh what are those you know the big arrows basilisks or the ballista ballistas you know or something just taking people out and i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on but i knew i knew what it was or elves you're up in the forest you're going to get [ __ ] by it i thought it was going to be a monster is it good that's cool i want to see another monster monster yes that'd be [ __ ] amazing so that that episode 10 out of 10 for me what about y'all no same i really like that one okay we're going on to episode two um this one is called caramorn caramorin okay so we finally see karen moore and caramorn's way cooler in the anime unfortunately you remember the the animated movie i highly recommend you go out and say yes more of those netflix the blood elves nah we need more of those animated ones where they do crazy [ __ ] with the powers and the animation anyways episode 2 is focused more on the elves this is where the series like that from that first episode to the second episode even i was like um yeah that's why i was like this is a part where it was like started getting slow for me come on you start off so strong but now like all right so we mean uh i'm gonna butcher all these names because they're difficult uh find a bar phil vandrel phil phillavandrel um and then with the elves and so they they're going along and they meet the deathless mother so the deathless mother is a huge part of this season um and and it that was the most intriguing part of this episode she's like this deathless mother is offering the promise to these three women red one it was uh jennifer yeah angela and the elf leaders white and red robe what because they all have uh different dreams but it's like a red rose she's different to everybody yeah yeah um and she's just promising you know their dreams and their power when really this is a creature we learned later on yeah this creature that feeds off pain and loss and you know this is an empty promise shit's going to blow up in your face but the two women take it uh of um there's franchises and friends chess could take it but siri you know she's super vulnerable because her whole thing is her power right that's what she has managed to to cling on to in her life because of what she's been through and because we've got a lot of uh yen's backstory this really does resonate and and i would believe that she would get so desperate that that she would be searching but she makes the right decision there she's not like ready to do whatever's like just tell me what to do i'll do it you know it's more mysterious it's more i have something to ask of you and then later on we know what that is that's the siri she wants siri um but okay so you got that then uh we get to care more and we see all the witchers and um i don't know why it just didn't feel like it did in the video game and [ __ ] like that it i just wish camoron was a little cooler and there was more witcher stuff like maybe just one combined witcher battle or some just something where they they bond right we know that they're friends and and every all the witchers come here and you know gather but i just needed a little bit more ask uh esco arrives late and it is because he was fighting aleshi now this is the big controversy because uh eskel is a fan favorite and you know in the books survives this they decide to use eskel as a plot point and kill off his character um well he murdered his character then they killed his character yes go ahead so he's supposed to be like all of the witchers in this series are punk ass [ __ ] minus geralt that's what i'm talking about [ __ ] horrible yeah geralt is powerful great awesome love it yeah that school is supposed to be like powerful too and he is a punk ass [ __ ] sometimes i feel like it's a punk ass and then you got all these like no-name buttholes and in the season at the very last season they're dying to monsters that we know that they should have no issues when there's a top like there's a ton of [ __ ] witches around and these are punk ass [ __ ] that are dying to no-name characters and they murdered our boy yep and he's supposed to outlive everyone and take over and do all this other stuff and they're like no no he died he did does he take over i i haven't read that far into it but i just know that esko is a [ __ ] badass and he's cool he's geralt's companion and it sucks that they used him as a plot point in order to uh how did they use them they uh they used him as a jumping off point for geralt to decide that siri needs training you know what i mean uh because at first you're kind of just bringing seared protector and then he brings the flu and he brings the is that in this episode i'm not sure that's in this episode but but there's the leshi that he fought and this leshi is like this really cool creature it's like this [ __ ] tree thing and i guess if it bites you it's it transfers its [ __ ] treeness to him so later on so that's the new mutation i'm in his back but no one's with your sense goes off no things are vibrating so like it's like everyone's holding on watching something's going on it's like how do you not notice this or like tell them because of the poor writing because what alex was on my [ __ ] back can you check it out yeah well he tells me hiding it joe and he's no so esko's one of those guys in a zombie movie that gets bit and then he doesn't tell anyone so everyone dies so they assassinated his character and this is one of the reasons why i gave this episode a five out of us it pissed me off yeah i was like [ __ ] dumb you're there this is what they do so it was cool i gave it a five because half is cool because i like the imagery i like the leshi i like when he turns into it i just wish they would have used so no name wisher yes there's no reason it had to be eskel and so you know [ __ ] five out of ten what did you what do you all think is this did the horse show up i honestly think so because he leaves no it has to be this episode because he leaves and then he transforms oh right and and he's like kissing up on somebody yeah so he transforms so it has to be this episode uh this one was like probably like a um like a four or five for me because i was like well this doesn't make sense why is he doing that he's like don't this i like that that's what's mother's day but yeah i didn't like the the decision that they made i go with the five because i do like that cool scenes like lighting up the sword and fights yes which is good this season like they have more budget or something or because at last i was like why the [ __ ] isn't geralt using this sign and this sign and then here they use it way more i'm like okay that's this this is a guy go for a five okay even though they [ __ ] up that they [ __ ] him up alex three yeah i i get it okay episode three is called what is lost what is lost and this is series training and i couldn't help but show my girlfriend i said oh this is okay so they're going to train so i show her the uh training scene from which are three and then we watch the trending scene here and i'm like oh yeah it just looked like a video game or like wipeout or something yeah yeah i was like i mean i could [ __ ] make it through that stupid [ __ ] it's like it just sucked i hate it yeah uh so serious training and then atissia is um she's she's dealing with loyalty issues here and she's arousing kind of suspicions and stuff and uh strogabor i did like this struggle more interrogates yen um and and then until she comes and intervenes yeah just get away from her you know i was like well this is [ __ ] crazy the mage stuff i like that made stuff and uh but they think yen is obviously uh you know a [ __ ] enemy because of their idiots i don't know why she [ __ ] destroyed the novguardian army essentially but they don't trust her so she must prove her loyalty but you know why right well yeah bad writing yes okay but she must prove her loyalty and everything okay um you know [ __ ] uh in front of the northern kingdoms even the king show up yeah and she's got to kill uh kahir and instead in the moment and she knows this is coming and you don't [ __ ] tell jenna for what to do so i like this part you never was like no [ __ ] this instead she sets freakah here and they run and it says okay well [ __ ] her she's uh obviously uh a bad guy who was killer and then um the elves settle in um centra under the nilf guardian uh protection and um and then at this point uh you know so they've got this plot point where you know the nilfgaardians will protect the elves so as long as the elves fight for that's what they're the mother creature told them to do and there she's trying to gain power uh frangilla and then the elves are just she's kind of focused on her baby and in the future of the elves and they form a kind of a temporary alliance um and then siri later on as she's training is attacked by a leshi who is immediately attacked by a bigger [ __ ] creature which i liked was always a bigger fish there's always a bigger fish this huge monster and uh and then of course we get a badass uh monster fight barrel uh geralt kills uh the monster so i like this one this one much better than the last episode uh we get that monster fight we get geralt being a badass and we get more of the political intrigue so that what for me was an eight out of five is this one where he walks into the the lake no okay no that's later on okay cool yeah we'll get there yep okay so this is eight out of ten they just kind of run into each other for me i know that that's episode six joe six got it this one um on this one okay i'm gonna give this one a six i i don't buy any of the stuff they're doing with yennefer and the the oh she's like freeing prisoners and trying to escape that i mean i don't see why she'd have loyalty to him in any way or what her motivations are and they never go anywhere with it so yeah they should have just like like did more with that i guess she's like well [ __ ] these people if they're not gonna believe me and they're gonna force me into this like it's a no-win situation what i did like her because of no one's situation she [ __ ] kills him and said look look she's [ __ ] evil and she will kill but that's what you asked her to do so it doesn't make sense you're right okay anyways episode four which is rodanian intelligence yes that's really the episode yes okay uh so rodanian intelligence uh tris arrives at care more in town train uh siri tris oh no that's not true i know it's yeah when if she walked in i was like she's trying honestly in the books at least in some of these books she's relatively uh doesn't have a whole lot um and trust has never been a huge character the video games kind of made her much better and much bigger and that's where we come from so that's why we're disappointed because she should look like the triss in the video games and i wish there was an actual reason to go team team jennifer team team tris here it's just team jennifer anyway so she she's helping and then they realize siri has elder blood and this elder blood can actually make more witches and flowers all the witches are dying right because the flowers grow near elder blood that's sweet it is [ __ ] sweet and uh they try to make a garden that's where she fell down yen and um here escape uh where elves are being prosecuted throughout the land because they are now working for nilfgaardians so wherever there's elves there's like underground railroads and stuff to get the elves to cintra um and because uh you know they think all elves are spies now and so you've got that sort of subplot of them being persecuted and then you have um what else um uh let's see uh dora dara is uh elf that we saw meet up be friends with siri and dara's subplot is is so lost this year this weekend for me was just a filler i'm just saying it is yeah yeah i didn't care about that um go ahead yeah i mean and then there's also the awkward like trace is like hey you want to come back to my bedroom oh yeah so i needed you just that night i needed you knows that she's alive and she's like you have you have a person that get the [ __ ] you ain't the real treasure yeah he knows i hook up with you but they do this stupid like five-year-old writing thing where it's like this girl who knows that jennifer is not dead she knows because she just got into a tub with her remember they just got into a tub and then she meets up with geralt and the girl's like oh and he's moping around because jennifer's dead and then none of them talk about anything because the writing is bad [ __ ] i can't remember because yeah it's in the tub with jennifer like you're all getting naked in the tub except for no one gets naked back no what i'm okay all right yeah okay sorry uh so bad writing uh so dara is uh sort of spying for cintra or on sintra and then uh yaskir is revealed to be the sandpiper or whatever and uh he's helping elves and i [ __ ] love his new song god damn this yaskara is done 10 out of 10. he's done well here um burn butcher burn but we all know what he really means yeah witcher because he's hurt yeah my girlfriend he's supposed to be my friend boyfriend and boyfriend and he hurt him uh yaskara is helping the elves so he actually helps yen and siri and uh including dara uh to help board this ship before um he has actually attacked himself and that's when this episode ends it's like what excuse me a little dirty here kind of stupid like really really stupid like this is cartoon level again terrible [ __ ] writing you are smuggling people who are going to be tortured and killed yeah underground railroad [ __ ] and then some guy insults your song and he raises everyone's life [ __ ] on who writes this [ __ ] and i know the answer is it's funny better it's i don't know that might have happened in the books i don't think i've read that part in blood of elves or if that's a thing it would be bad in the book no i i kind of like that he's so full of himself that he has to get in the last word that seems like yeah scared i mean he gets in the last word but i agree this was an underwhelming episode that would have been five out of ten that would have been better if he's like well they just started talking about the lyrics i was like well what do you do what do you think about this this this and they're like hey what are you doing we're trying to smuggle in it's like oh i forgot something like that some simple as opposed to like well no i'm gonna have to fight this guy okay and then a guy who literally dies and gets beat five out of ten for me because i agree with what y'all are saying four okay uh moving on to episode five uh which is turn your back okay this is the fire mage uh he's freed and there's uh somebody hires this guy and he's like uh we don't know who's hiring him uh and then then we do the yaskir song again this one made me really confused at the beginning i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on it's all the same extras i already watched this and well it was because it was from a different angle alex and and it was the fire mage was there the whole time and he's kind of hunting it down and that's who captured uh yes gear from the last episode and i really like this one because uh jennifer comes in all drunk and helps david i was like man that's a great scene yeah where she [ __ ] blows uh all her alcohol in his face when he's trying to be like i'm a farmer yeah doing this stupid every time he came in i was like it just reminded me of like what was a west side story i was coming in snapping i was like oh god here we go just spits in his face and he's like she [ __ ] him up and she rescues uh dandelion and then we also get a dream walk from tris so tris actually does something and she [ __ ] uh kind of explores siri's subconscious in her ancestry and history uh where she has a scene of all of her friends in there but then there's some [ __ ] happening it's like what is going on of this elf who is holding this baby and she's telling them this baby [ __ ] humans betray us and you're going to be the key and all this other stuff and so while simultaneously uh uh asia the geralt meets up with uh forget this mages guy's name is israeli it's a drill or some i don't know uh jennifer's old boyfriend oh yeah you know that guy that's doing like the research and [ __ ] yeah yeah and then he's like oh yeah yeah i'm only here because of a girl yeah yemi and he's like yen because they all have the pet names for and they realize that uh they're both uh in love with yennefer and they both have bad things but they investigate the monoliths together um and then we get more of this here he can bring back the witchers and she's like i'll do it on the one condition then i can be a witcher myself and i'll go through the process first uh and so vesamir agrees um because it's her decision and tris is all like it's got to be her decision for this other thing and so he twists that and makes it her decision there he's like it's her decision and uh but then geralt shows up last minute and my girlfriend was like how the [ __ ] girl get there i was like what they don't show it enough but there's portals you know mages so that made portal geralt back to where he was and he made every character he's fast travels yeah uh and this part of the game so this is one of the episodes that i did like in terms of writing and reveals and i thought and while there's no fighting in this episode i thought this episode was still good you have the fire mage you got uh you know jennifer hell helping dandelion you got the dream walk you got the geralt and this guy investigating the monoliths like what the [ __ ] is going on here you got the siri backstory and then the geralt uh rescuing siri and making her realize you know because siri just needs a place to be and she wants to forget about stuff and find a new purpose and and girls like this is this is not the way you know because she could have died and she probably would have died honestly because making witchers is so stupid and we saw that from the anime like that is yeah that's the stupidest way to make it get the [ __ ] out here's a stick fight the most dangerous creature in the [ __ ] thing and then and then go through all these processes where you're gonna die and only the strongest survive anyway she probably would have died anyway so i really like this episode and i want to give this one probably uh uh an eight out of ten i would give this one a seven like yeah there wasn't a lot of uh fighting but there was a lot of crucial points that like for the story that helped you explain what's going on to further the story so i'm gonna give this one seven uh i i think this one was pretty good other than i don't like anything they did with vesamir in this episode at all i think that characters withholding the seriousness the seriousness of consequences and like what is going to happen is another bad writing where vesimir doesn't say girl you're going to die this thing kills the majority of people he kind of does but he doesn't i guess alex wants him to be like no you will die you think vesimir would sacrificially sacrifice geralt's daughter with geralt not there you're [ __ ] out of your mind to continue the witchers he's gone through and and and had to mourn i think that he would but at the end but at the end you can see not even he is for that it has to seriously that [ __ ] up because that's the thing is be apparently according to all the people who read the books vezmir does not want more witchers they just made it up for the show oh [ __ ] [ __ ] so so it's like they they wildly change all this stuff and then they don't even write it in a way that's satisfying to me look i still like this episode it is better than all the other ones i can see that if you've read the books and it's not following the way the books is you're gonna hate it but you know what [ __ ] it to me that's like i don't care because i have three different witchers to appreciate i have the video games to appreciate i have the books to appreciate and i have this series to appreciate now when they make a wrong decision we get to [ __ ] about it like like this yeah in that school okay that's cool so what what did you give me six six okay so moving on to episode six joe this is the one that you were talking about so anyway a monster attacks right away [ __ ] hated the fact that it manages to scratch uh roach and [ __ ] i hate it okay so so i have some good news for you joe because i hated it just as much made me want to cry it was the most emotional moment and it was broke it was a horse well it turns out that uh geralt it's not just that's he didn't just have one roach of course he's like he names all of his horses yeah so there's been like five roaches so that helps a little bit you're telling me there's like millions of shamus yeah yeah what yeah there's no joy um and then also in this episode the fire mage attacks uh and uh because he knows where maureen is too yeah everyone knows we followed somebody there's a sign which and then this way and then uh and then witcher geralt and siri go to uh naneke and jennifer sees her and meets geralt there and later on we learn about jennifer's betrayal and that's how the fire mage is there as well uh but in this instance we think it's just a coincidence and we get the reunion reuniting between geralt and yennefer um and then we get the stuff about siri couldn't potentially break the cycle of hatred um and and then in this episode we also get the elf baby born and then all the elves are [ __ ] super happy um and then uh the fire mage attacks them at that location and jennifer wall gerrill is doing this badass [ __ ] scene and they they've really improved their camera work and stuff it's really awesome he manages to beat everybody up and jennifer takes siri into this back room and i'm like just wait there girls got it and girl got it and he goes over there too and and then he sees [ __ ] jennifer was rightfully trying to portal them out she doesn't have the thing and that's fine because she doesn't know what he's going to win or not but once he wins she has siri go through the portal and then girls like stop i i i won and then jennifer goes through the portal too and he's like [ __ ] you know because he's going to betray me yeah he's jennifer essentially betrays girl and takes siri two sacrifices to sacrifice her um because she wants her powers and then at the same time the mage dude uh goes in to this uh eccentric bookstore and learns from these crazy characters that um this series is essentially a generational weapon they're looking at uh you know her bloodlines and their [ __ ] missing and stuff about ryan well the story from that first episode is the story that gets told where there's the remember he plays the thing in the beginning where he's talking about the the man and then the elf woman and they have a baby but there was betrayal and then that's bloodline go leads all the way to syria and uh and then at the end tris is very shocked by what her dream walk revealed and she's shaken and she actually tells uh vesamir what's up with siri and then she even goes and tells her may's friend my [ __ ] trish over here the [ __ ] narc telling everybody about siri and you know it's like goddammit trish uh you know because it's tris no she's church she's a ripoff uh anyways so trish from wish um i really like this episode we also got geralt you know being a badass and [ __ ] killing that uh what do they call it sendo i forget what that when he walks out in the middle of the water and then he fights this yeah so i really like this one despite roach dying i would give this one a nine out of ten i think it's one of the other big uh good episodes uh with the same i agree with all those points i'm gonna go with an eight for this one though okay one out of ten to kill roach justice no come on it was super sick come on it's yeah it's six okay okay seven and then we have episode seven which is wallet mirror [Music] that's their which thing that you know this this subplot that's been going on with the deathless mother so uh yaskir or geralt frees yes gear from prison they have a moment it's fun uh and then geralt realizes that yen is in league with the deathless mother he uh gets help from his dwarven crew uh who i like him i like him a lot joe but they look hilarious in battle and i had to tell my girlfriend i was like in the books they're a little more stalking they're a little more muscular and they are badass fighters because they don't look like they're they can uh you know but they weren't holding their own but they're all in their own anyways uh and then uh so the baby is born and obviously you know uh friendzilla's like okay so we're gonna you know fight for the i was like nah man we got a new baby we're just gonna do our own thing now i'm like what the [ __ ] man the elves are stupid as [ __ ] cause like you don't [ __ ] pledge allegiance and then have a baby born anything that happens to you at this point you're it's your [ __ ] fault why would the [ __ ] would you have the baby on some [ __ ] room she's like oh this is my precious cargo stay with me stay with me she cares about that baby so much that she's gonna leave the baby out of her sight all the time yeah what the [ __ ] anyway so the elves are like we're going to focus on ourselves and for jill's like what the [ __ ] girl we even had that moment earlier when we were girl and you're not to feed thousands of elves that aren't farming it's blood over friendship and suck [ __ ] what the [ __ ] and then siri uh she [ __ ] um well jennifer actually touches jennifer and finds out that and by the way yeah we forgot to mention yennefer's help training syrian series you know they do this uh where to get across the river and siri and jana realized oh you [ __ ] might be more powerful than me bleeding everywhere damn yeah um but yeah uh she sees jennifer's betrayal of her uh has an outburst which brings a patrol and then just then geralt and his friends show up to rescue them and it was i i really liked it because gerald then [ __ ] drew the blade yes i love that part it's like everyone leave you stevie i was like oh he holds her i gotta kill a monster i was like damn um that's what you get though yep nobody forgave her immediately uh so time was running out he loves her quite a bit uh but anyway uh the elf baby is murdered yeah that's what you were pointing out there and this gives uh the witch lady volith mir now has the strength to sort of break fee he realizes that jennifer has made that pack he's like say the words so that they're both teleported to that area and he can go [ __ ] beat up on that walking house from final fantasy 7 but unfortunately because of the elf baby being murdered and all the elves going through their pain she has enough to escape the little area before girl can actually go kill her so this was the culmination of the deathless mother uh subplot yes and then at the end siri gets possessed yeah not i think yeah yeah next episode she gets possessed no or right at the end she gets right right at the end she gets possessed so this one is seven out of ten episode seven seven out of ten for me good for me okay wow i like the little fight with the i love that squad all right oh yeah it's amazing i want to see more of them right okay episode eight the final episode so we get a possessed siri and then we get the basilisk battle so it turns out there's another monolith in karamorin and she's able to break free and summon some of these basilisks and unfortunately whereas the cgi had been working and a lot of the other ones i think it works a little less here and you know you think in your mind how badass these witches can be and fight and it's something we pointed out in the anime where it's like this is how it's done you can do some badass fights with witchers unfortunately here all the witchers feel like [ __ ] little [ __ ] and they're not using their powers geralt's really the only one using his powers the way he should and the other ones are [ __ ] dumb as [ __ ] as they're in this battle and it's just awkward to have them fight these basilisks uh francesca kills um the human babies that's right yeah that's crazy she goes all the way to redania and kills all the [ __ ] human babies when it's like she burns them alive right yeah yeah some kind of fireman yeah you see the baby the baby's like burning has like the little insignificant thing and then yeah it's uh she's pretty [ __ ] up crush uh and then jennifer offers herself to the witch to as to be a host and that sort of is the way that the witch breaks free or the witch is ex expelled from siri's body it's a combination of things because in series head she's having the conflict of she's back home she sees her mother and father she's like trapped inside but someone's not right here and geralt's calling out to her so a combination of geralt calling out to her this is your home and well while uh you know vesemir and all these other witchers are trying to block and and keep her contained uh and fight the basilisks but i think it was jennifer's sacrifice of herself that that yeah she cut herself and then the thing left yeah it is it was and then simultaneously they're transported to an unknown world um and this was the theory from the mage dude and geralt that there are other spheres they talk about other spheres that you know have come together and and they're spilling the monsters out into our sphere and stuff and that's fascinating and this is where some of these entities uh have actually originated from so the entity uh gets to go back to its sphere and uh and then we see the wild hunt uh [ __ ] galloping towards them and i'm like man that's cool i hope you know we'll get to see the wild hun and geralt confront that um and then they come back uh from that universe or sphere and jen's powers are back as she has immediately shown like healing a witcher and he's like holy [ __ ] they should have made that a little bit bigger thing but yeah she's like episode after episode she's trying to get her power back so i got it back yeah that was too quick like explain yourself i just didn't come across it was because she was because they made it up for the show and it was willing she was making willing to make the sacrifice and then apparently that's supposed to be for all is forgiven with siri i tried to [ __ ] murder you i tried it was gonna [ __ ] kill her he's like that you kill you're killing all my [ __ ] witchers oh yeah it's still siri is like [ __ ] that yeah yeah it's it gets pretty wild there and um but it's also they had to let go the of the hate yeah so it does so they bring it back full circle they mess with the characters motivations and what they would do but it does end up you know in a good place uh finally but then after that battle and it's everybody in this goddamn world is after siri because the secret is out [ __ ] can't get their mouth shut now that person knows this person knows all these mages and everybody knows uh everybody wants her and geralt is like we have to protect we cannot stay here i care more we gotta leave and then finally sort of the last one is amir the emperor is coming and oh by the way franzila has a badass scene where like these [ __ ] generals are disrespecting her and just being she needs to take power yeah it's a great [ __ ] scene where she [ __ ] freezes uh-huh and she literally kills them while they're [ __ ] like so i was like damn this scene is off um and she kind of takes uh power back for ourselves he's like this is what we're going to do you know here's how we're going to run this and so kair kahran come up with this thing that we're we'll take credit for the baby killing because that you know you know sows fear amongst our enemies and [ __ ] and we'll take credit for this and this and this well it turns out amir's like you [ __ ] liars i killed the [ __ ] baby you know uh and summoned my daughter and she reveals that siri is his daughter and that's partly why he sent his armies in there and assigned him to go find her i think they're going to change what his plans are you know the whole no not marry the daughter thing oh oh yeah don't say so uh and then he has frangilla and kahir arrested so their fate is up in the air so another good episode uh i'll give this one an eight out of ten i'll give this one a three this was one i actually had the most trouble with uh this is one where i think that they disrespected witchers entirely the whole basis of the show are these badass monster hunters and i think they did a [ __ ] terrible job showing that the witch's fight even generic wingless basilisks i gave i gave it too much of an excuse just because i like the show so much and the budget and that's like yeah this is not gonna happen like the anime yeah i also hate when storytellers have someone be possessed and then someone is like no use the power of love come back to us fight in your it's like this is an ageless demon that is able to hold down the most three powerful sorceresses in the world and it's like me whispering in your like no fighting that's hot it's care bears there was a story sewer child orgy in it the book and they removed it because it was bad it's like you can remove bad things from the books when you adapt it to to other mediums and i didn't like that that ending i don't like that amir publicly in front of thousands of people says this is who i am bring me my daughter it just kind of ruins the whole and it was the the exact same actor right from her father it's her father yeah from from from the earth yeah ultimately i don't think that the deathless mother storyline which was unfortunately the whole overarching bad guy i think ultimately worked for me i don't think like forgives yen for the whole i'm gonna murder her i don't think he's forgiven her yet i think that you're gonna get some of that in season three uh i hope so i just didn't get any of that here and so like this this show did not end in a satisfying way where i felt like i'm excited to see where this goes more like this is just like all right i guess i'm gonna have to watch four more seasons of this yeah for me i'm probably gonna go with a six i was probably out at seven but after everything uh six for me i didn't like the whole possession thing uh the fighting could have been a little bit better yes i did like it when obviously best me and they're too badass everyone else is like oh somebody died i don't know what the [ __ ] that was whatever jim jim jim the wizard and then billy died i don't know what the [ __ ] happened but six yep whenever i think of the wild hunt i think of like frost though isn't that like in the video game or huh do you think like ice planet type stuff yeah yeah because like usually whenever the frost is coming in the video game well it's not the video game though what i'm just saying that's what i incorporated but then like they're over here i was like wait what are they in mars and then while it comes like that's supposed all right well six for me okay yeah so i i think uh this you know um up and down in this season but more ups than downs though there were some down downs um and i'm i am excited towards season three i i'm just fascinated by it and i'm i'm hoping that it does get better and the geralt has more input originally just to show you uh you know to alex point the writers had geralt saying nothing about roach's death that that's how they wrote it and gary and henry cavill was like no i am going to say something about roach's death and and one of the writers is like okay you know come tomorrow with your own interpretation and he came with that beautiful uh tribute that he gave to roach and he said that beautiful eulogy um and that was that was all henry cavill and they were gonna give him they were just gonna move on get more freedom let him like rewrite up the script please i hope in season three henry gets a little more control over uh his character and and some of these changes because you're right i don't think he would have been down for some of the changes that they made but we'll see what happens in season three maybe i might get sick of their [ __ ] if they continue doing some of the [ __ ] um but more more budget more money the show's doing well and uh give give henry some more control and i think we'll be back on track hopefully um the third season probably obviously based on more books we might get more wild hunt stuff like that we saw in the video game whereas witcher 3 video game resolve that you know uh to a certain extent it's not resolved here they don't have they don't they don't encounter the witch the wild hunt they don't fight anything let's stretch it out yeah and or more in the final stand or anything like that we're probably gonna get see some of that in season three so anyways that's it guys i hope you like that
