1,CRASH THE JEEP,
2,Red Light Green Light,"Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie up
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it

Red light, green light
I'm fucking a bitch in my g-nights
I hop out with that stick with that be like
My patner wanna see something killed
That's what he like
Told the first nigga try gon' tell G
How I bent out that motherfucking Saks since a knee high
Since a nappy head black gangsta peon
Have emotion I'm prime time like Deon
How she throw it, I snap from the behind
Hold up, look at the fit on me
Go get the tissue, that shit on me
Lie for me, die for me, kill for me, shit
Thick in the balls when she lick on me
I told her, ""Bae show me you love me"" (Show me)
Let 'em know out in public (Let em' know)
Uh huh, let em know while we fucking
They try me, it go down, you know how I'm coming

Yeah, rich ass stepper
The big white seats
Bitch, that's leather
I wanna fuck her and her friend
And I heard birds of the same feather
They flock together (Let's go)
I'm dangerous, they prolly tell you
What they say?
Don't play with him they 'bout whatever
Ah I get in there, she say I'm pressure
(Get in there) anywhere any time bitch whoever
But hold up

Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie (Park it)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it

Red light, green light (Let's go)
Nigga touch one of yours he gon' see right
I'ma spend every dollar til he die
I make him slide 365, you don't think right
That's 11 months straight nigga sleep tight
I tried to be patient with niggas that ain't right
Give 'em game they couldn't take niggas ain't it
Rate me one out of ten they gon' say ten
Who that bad bitch on camera, let bae in
Who that is back to back hope that's baby
Can't do no shows he for stadiums
I like my Lamborghinis 'cause they drive fast
But the Maybach that's prolly my favorite whip
I'm in the back seat with my feet up reclined
Getting my dick rolled like the Mercedes Benz
And I pop big shit so I don't check when they talking
If you dish shit out, you gotta take it in
I be like hold up

Baby
Prolly in a fast car riding with the cap off
Pull off with a bad broad
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
And back on that big homie up (Park it)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it
Red light, green light
Bitch, okay, uh
Oh oh oh oh okay

I'm back on that big homie up
Hop out the coupe with that shit on me
Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on it
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it
Red light, green light"

4,Suge,"Pooh, you a fool for this one
Ha
Oh lord, Jetson made another one

Pack in the mail, it's gone (Uh)
She like how I smell, cologne (Yeah)
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah

Good, good
Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga (Ha)
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood and come buy me a nigga (No cap)
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out guns, I'm gon' shot me a nigga (No cap)
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga (Ha)
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures (Bitch, uh)

Talkin' 'bout, ""Shit I'm gon' pop that"" (Pop)
Got like thirty-two thousand in one of my pockets
The other one, that's where the Glock at (Glock)
You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that (Ha)
Beat and burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at (Bitch)
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back (Vroom)
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music (Ha)
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off of pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter (The fuck?)
